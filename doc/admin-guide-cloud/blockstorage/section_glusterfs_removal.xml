    <title>Gracefully remove a GlusterFS volume from usage</title>
        <para>Configuring the <systemitem>cinder</systemitem> volume
        service to use GlusterFS involves creating a shares file (for
        example, <filename>/etc/cinder/glusterfs</filename>). This
        shares file lists each GlusterFS volume (with its
        corresponding storage server) that the
        <systemitem>cinder</systemitem> volume service can use for
        back end storage.</para>
        <para>To remove a GlusterFS volume from usage as a back end,
        delete the volume's corresponding entry from the shares file.
        After doing so, restart the Block Storage services.</para>
        <para os="rhel;centos;fedora;opensuse;sles">To restart the
        Block Storage services on CentOS, Fedora, openSUSE, Red Hat
        Enterprise Linux, or SUSE Linux Enterprise, run:</para>
        <screen os="rhel;centos;fedora;opensuse;sles"><prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>for i in api scheduler volume; do service openstack-cinder-$i restart; done</userinput></screen>
        <para os="debian;ubuntu">To restart the Block Storage services
        on Ubuntu or Debian, run:</para>
        <screen os="debian;ubuntu"><prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>for i in api scheduler volume; do service cinder-${i} restart; done</userinput></screen>
        <para>Restarting the Block Storage services will prevent
        the <systemitem>cinder</systemitem> volume service from
        exporting the deleted GlusterFS volume. This will prevent
        any instances from mounting the volume from that point
        onwards.</para>
        <para>However, the removed GlusterFS volume might still be
        mounted on an instance at this point. Typically, this is the
        case when the volume was already mounted while its entry was
        deleted from the shares file. Whenever this occurs, you
        will have to unmount the volume as normal after the Block
        Storage services are restarted.</para>
