    <title>Back up and restore volumes</title>
    <para>The <command>cinder</command> command-line interface
    provides the tools for creating a volume backup. You can restore
    a volume from a backup as long as the backup's associated database
    information (or backup metadata) is intact in the Block Storage
    database.
    </para>
    <para>Run this command to create a backup of a volume:</para>
    <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>cinder backup-create <replaceable>VOLUME</replaceable></userinput></screen>
    <para>Where <replaceable>VOLUME</replaceable> is the name or ID of
    the volume.</para>
    <para>The previous command will also return a backup ID. Use this
    backup ID when restoring the volume, as in:</para>
    <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>cinder backup-restore <replaceable>backup_ID</replaceable></userinput></screen>
    <para>As mentioned earlier, volume backups are dependent on the
    Block Storage database. Because of this, we recommend that you
    also back up your Block Storage database regularly in order to
    ensure data recovery.</para>
    <note><para>Alternatively, you can export and save the metadata of
    selected volume backups. Doing so will preclude the need to
    back up the entire Block Storage database. This is particularly
    useful if you only need a small subset of volumes to survive a
    catastrophic database failure.</para>

    backup metadata, see <xref linkend="volume-backup-restore-export-import"/>.</para></note>
