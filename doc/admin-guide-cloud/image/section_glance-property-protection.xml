  <title>Image property protection</title>
  <para>An image property is a key and value pair that is attached to
    OpenStack Image Service image.</para>
  <para>Core properties, such as the image name, are defined and set
    by the cloud administrator. Additional properties, such as
    licensing and billing information, are defined and set by the
    cloud administrator and the image owner.</para>
  <para>The cloud administrator can configure any property as
      <glossterm baseform="protected property">protected</glossterm>,
    which limits which user roles can perform CRUD operations on that
    property. Protected properties are generally extra properties to
    which only cloud administrators have access.</para>
  <para>For unprotected image properties, the cloud administrator can
    manage core properties and the image owner can manage additional
    properties.</para>
