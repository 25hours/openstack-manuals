  <title>Networking architecture</title>
  <para>Before you deploy Networking, it's useful to understand the
      Networking services and how they interact with the OpenStack
     components.</para>

       <title>Overview</title>
            <para>Networking is a standalone component in the OpenStack modular
            architecture. It's positioned alongside OpenStack components such
            as Compute, Image service, Identity, or the Dashboard. Like
            those components, a deployment of Networking often involves
            deploying several services to a variety of hosts.</para>
            <para>The Networking server uses the <systemitem class="service"
                >neutron-server</systemitem> daemon to expose the Networking
                API and enable administration of the configured Networking
                plug-in. Typically, the plug-in requires access to a database
                for persistent storage (also similar to other OpenStack
                services).</para>
            <para>If your deployment uses a controller host to run centralized
            Compute components, you can deploy the Networking server to that
            same host. However, Networking is entirely standalone and can be
            deployed to a dedicated host. Depending on your configuration,
            Networking can also include the following agents:</para>

        <para>OpenStack Networking uses the NSX plug-in to
        integrate with an existing VMware vCenter deployment. When installed on
        the network nodes, the NSX plug-in enables a NSX controller to centrally
        manage configuration settings and push them to managed network nodes.
        Network nodes are considered managed when they're added as hypervisors
        to the NSX controller.</para>
      <para>The diagrams below depict some VMware NSX deployment examples.
        The first diagram illustrates the traffic flow between VMs on separate
        Compute nodes, and the second diagram between two VMs on a single
        Compute node. Note the placement of the VMware NSX plug-in and the
        <systemitem class="service">neutron-server</systemitem> service on the
        network node. The green arrow indicates the management relationship
        between the NSX controller and the network node.</para>
