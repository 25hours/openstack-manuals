        <title>Problem</title>
        <para>This error may be caused by a volume being exported outside of OpenStack using a
            host name different from the system name that OpenStack expects. This error could be displayed with the IQN if the host was exported using iSCSI.</para>
        <programlisting>Duplicate3PARHost: 3PAR Host already exists: Host wwn 50014380242B9750 already used by host cld4b5ubuntuW(id = 68. The hostname must be called 'cld4b5ubuntuâ€˜.</programlisting>

        <title>Solution</title>
        <para>Change the 3PAR host name to match the one that OpenStack expects. The 3PAR host
            constructed by the driver uses just the local hostname, not the fully qualified domain
            name (FQDN) of the compute host. For example, if the FQDN was
                <emphasis>myhost.example.com</emphasis>, just <emphasis>myhost</emphasis> would be
            used as the 3PAR hostname. IP addresses are not allowed as host names on the 3PAR
            storage server.</para>
