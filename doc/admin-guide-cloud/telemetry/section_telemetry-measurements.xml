  <title>Measurements</title>
  <para>The Telemetry module collects meters within an OpenStack
    deployment. This section provides a brief summary about meters
    format and origin and also contains the list of available
    meters.</para>
  <para>Telemetry collects meters by polling the infrastructure
    elements and also by consuming the notifications emitted
    by other OpenStack services. For more information about the
    polling mechanism and notifications see
    <xref linkend="section_telemetry-data-collection"/>. There are
    several meters which are collected by polling and by consuming.
    The origin for each meter is listed in the tables below.</para>
  <note>
    <para>You may need to configure Telemetry or other OpenStack
      services in order to be able to collect all the samples you need.
      For further information about configuration requirements see the

  <para>Telemetry provides the possibility to store metadata for
    samples. This metadata can be extended for OpenStack Compute and
    OpenStack Object Storage.</para>
  <para>In order to add additional metadata information to OpenStack
    Compute you have two options to choose from. The first one is to
    specify them when you boot up a new instance. The additional
    information will be stored with the sample in the form of
    <literal>resource_metadata.user_metadata.*</literal>. The new
    field should be defined by using the prefix <literal>metering.</literal>.
    The modified boot command look like the following:
    <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>nova boot --meta metering.custom_metadata=a_value my_vm</userinput></screen></para>
  <para>The other option is to set the <option>reserved_metadata_keys</option>
    to the list of metadata keys that you would like to be included
    in <literal>resource_metadata</literal> of the instance related
    samples that are collected for OpenStack Compute. This option is
    included in the <literal>DEFAULT</literal> section of the
    <filename>ceilometer.conf</filename> configuration file.</para>
  <para>You might also specify headers whose values will be stored along with
    the sample data of OpenStack Object Storage. The additional
    information is also stored under <literal>resource_metadata</literal>.
    The format of the new field is <literal>
    resource_metadata.http_header_$name</literal>, where <literal>
    $name</literal> is the name of the header with <literal>-</literal>
    replaced by <literal>_</literal>.</para>
  <para>For specifying the new header, you need to set <option>
    metadata_headers</option> option under the <literal>[filter:ceilometer]</literal>
    section in <filename>proxy-server.conf</filename> under the
    <literal>swift</literal> folder. You can use this additional data
    for instance to distinguish external and internal users.</para>
  <para>The list of measurements is grouped by services which
    are polled by Telemetry or emits notifications that this module
    consumes.</para>
  <note>
    <para>The Telemetry module supports storing notifications as
      events. This functionality was added later, therefore the list
      of meters still contains existence type and other event related
      items. The proper way of using Telemetry is to configure it to
      use the event store and turn off the collection of the event
      related meters. For further information about events see <link xlink:href=
      "http://docs.openstack.org/developer/ceilometer/events.html">Events
      section</link> in the Telemetry documentation. For further
      information about how to turn on and off meters see
      <xref linkend="section_telemetry-pipeline-configuration"/>. Please
      also note that currently no migration is available to move the already
      existing event type samples to the event store.</para>

    <para>The Telemetry module supports to create new meters by using
      transformers. For more details about transformers see
      <xref linkend="section_telemetry-pipeline-transformers"/>. Among the meters
      gathered from Libvirt and HyperV there are a few ones, which are generated from
      other meters.  The list of meters that are created by using the

    <note>
      <para>To enable the libvirt <literal>memory.usage</literal> support,
      you need to install Libvirt version 1.1.1+, Qemu version 1.5+, and
      you also need to prepare suitable balloon driver in the image. It is
      applicable particularly for Windows guests, most modern Linux
      distributions already have it built in. Telemetry is not able to
      fetch the <literal>memory.usage</literal> samples without
      the image balloon driver.</para>

    <para>OpenStack Compute is capable of collecting <literal>CPU</literal>
      related meters from the compute host machines. In order to use that
      you need to set the <option>compute_monitors</option> option to
      <literal>ComputeDriverCPUMonitor</literal> in the <filename>nova.conf</filename>
      configuration file. For further information see the Compute configuration
      section in the <link xlink:href=
