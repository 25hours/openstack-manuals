=====================
Network connectivity
=====================

The selected server hardware must have the appropriate number of
network connections, as well as the right type of network
connections, in order to support the proposed architecture. Ensure
that, at a minimum, there are at least two diverse network
connections coming into each rack.

The selection of form factors or architectures affects the selection of
server hardware. Ensure that the selected server hardware is configured
to support enough storage capacity (or storage expandability) to match
the requirements of selected scale-out storage solution. Similarly, the
network architecture impacts the server hardware selection and vice
versa.
