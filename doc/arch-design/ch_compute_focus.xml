    <title>Compute focused</title>

  <para>A compute-focused cloud is a specialized subset of the general purpose
    OpenStack cloud architecture. Unlike the general purpose OpenStack
    architecture, which hosts a wide variety of workloads and
    applications and does not heavily tax any particular computing aspect,
    a compute-focused cloud specifically supports
    compute intensive workloads. Compute intensive
    workloads may be CPU intensive, RAM intensive, or both; they are
    not typically storage intensive or network intensive. Compute-focused
    workloads may include the following use cases:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>High performance computing (HPC)</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Big data analytics using Hadoop or other distributed data
        stores</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Signal processing for network function virtualization (NFV)</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>Based on the use case requirements, such clouds might need to provide
    additional services such as a virtual machine disk library, file or object
    storage, firewalls, load balancers, IP addresses, or network connectivity
    in the form of overlays or virtual local area networks (VLANs). A
    compute-focused OpenStack cloud does not typically use raw block storage
    services as it does not generally host applications that require
    persistent block storage.</para>
