    <para>A <glossterm baseform="hybrid cloud">hybrid cloud</glossterm> design
        is one that uses more than one cloud. For example, designs that use
        both an OpenStack-based private cloud and an OpenStack-based public
        cloud, or that use an OpenStack cloud and a non-OpenStack cloud,
        are hybrid clouds.</para>

        practice of creating new instances in an external cloud to alleviate
        capacity issues in a private cloud.</para>

    <para>Hybrid clouds interact with systems that are outside
        the control of the private cloud administrator, and require careful
        architecture to prevent conflicts with hardware, software,
        and APIs under external control.</para>
    <para>The degree to which the architecture is OpenStack-based
        affects your ability to accomplish tasks with native
        OpenStack tools. By definition, this is a situation in which
        no single cloud can provide all of the necessary
        functionality. In order to manage the entire system, we recommend
        using a cloud management platform (CMP).</para>
    <para>There are several commercial and open source CMPs available,
        but there is no single CMP that can address all needs in all scenarios,
        and sometimes a manually-built solution is the best option.
        This chapter includes discussion of using CMPs for managing a hybrid
        cloud.</para>
