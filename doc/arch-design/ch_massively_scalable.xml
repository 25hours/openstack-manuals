    <title>Massively scalable</title>

    <para>A massively scalable architecture is a cloud
        implementation that is either a very large deployment, such as
        a commercial service provider might build, or
        one that has the capability to support user requests for large
        amounts of cloud resources. An example is an
        infrastructure in which requests to service 500 or more instances
        at a time is common. A massively scalable infrastructure
        fulfills such a request without exhausting the available
        cloud infrastructure resources. While the high capital cost
        of implementing such a cloud architecture means that it is
        currently in limited use, many organizations are planning
        for massive scalability in the future.</para>
    <para>A massively scalable OpenStack cloud design presents a
        unique set of challenges and considerations. For the most part
        it is similar to a general purpose cloud architecture, as it
        is built to address a non-specific range of potential use
        cases or functions. Typically, it is rare that particular
        workloads determine the design or configuration of massively
        scalable clouds. Like the general purpose cloud, the massively
        scalable cloud is most often built as a platform for a variety
        of workloads. Because private organizations rarely require
        or have the resources for them, massively scalable OpenStack clouds
        are generally built as commercial, public cloud offerings.</para>

    <para>Like a general purpose cloud, the instances deployed in a
        massively scalable OpenStack cloud do not necessarily use
        any specific aspect of the cloud offering (compute, network,
        or storage). As the cloud grows in scale, the number of
        workloads can cause stress on all the cloud
        components. This adds further stresses to supporting
        infrastructure such as databases and message brokers. The
        architecture design for such a cloud must account for these
        performance pressures without negatively impacting user
        experience.</para>
