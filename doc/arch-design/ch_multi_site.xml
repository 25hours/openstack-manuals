    <para>A multi-site OpenStack environment is one in which services
        located in more than one data center are used to provide the
        overall solution. Usage requirements of different multi-site
        clouds may vary widely, however they share some common needs.
        OpenStack is capable of running in a multi-region
        configuration allowing some parts of OpenStack to effectively
        manage a grouping of sites as a single cloud. With some
        careful planning in the design phase, OpenStack can act as an
        excellent multi-site cloud solution for a multitude of
        needs.</para>
    <para>Some use cases that might indicate a need for a multi-site
        deployment of OpenStack include:</para>
