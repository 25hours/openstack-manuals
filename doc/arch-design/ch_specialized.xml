    <para>Although most OpenStack architecture designs fall into one
        of the seven major scenarios outlined in other sections
        (compute focused, network focused, storage focused, general
        purpose, multi-site, hybrid cloud, and massively scalable),
        there are a few other use cases that are unique enough they
        can't be neatly categorized into one of the other major
        sections. This section discusses some of these unique use
        cases with some additional details and design considerations
        for each use case:</para>

              private or public clouds.
