    <title>Specialized cases</title>
    <para>Although most OpenStack architecture designs fall into one
        of the seven major scenarios outlined in other sections
        (compute focused, network focused, storage focused, general
        purpose, multi-site, hybrid cloud, and massively scalable),
        there are a few use cases that do not fit into these categories.
        This section discusses these specialized cases and provide
        some additional details and design considerations
        for each use case:</para>
