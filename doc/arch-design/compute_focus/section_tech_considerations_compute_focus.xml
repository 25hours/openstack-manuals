    <title>Technical considerations</title>
    <para>In a compute-focused OpenStack cloud, the type of instance
        workloads you provision heavily influences technical
        decision making. For example, specific use cases that demand
        multiple, short-running jobs present different requirements
        than those that specify long-running jobs, even though both
        situations are compute focused.</para>
    <para>Public and private clouds require deterministic capacity
        planning to support elastic growth in order to meet user SLA
        expectations. Deterministic capacity planning is the path to
        predicting the effort and expense of making a given process
        perform consistently. This process is important because,
        when a service becomes a critical part of a user's
        infrastructure, the user's experience links directly to the SLAs of
        the cloud itself. In cloud computing, it is not average speed but
        speed consistency that determines a service's performance.
        There are two aspects of capacity planning to consider:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>planning the initial deployment footprint</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>planning expansion of it to stay ahead of the demands of cloud
        users</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Plan the initial footprint for an OpenStack deployment
        based on existing infrastructure workloads
        and estimates based on expected uptake.</para>
    <para>The starting point is the core count of the cloud. By
        applying relevant ratios, the user can gather information
        about:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>The number of expected concurrent instances:
            (overcommit fraction × cores) / virtual cores per instance</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Required storage: flavor disk size × number of instances</para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Use these ratios to determine the amount of
        additional infrastructure needed to support the cloud. For
        example, consider a situation in which you require 1600
        instances, each with 2 vCPU and 50 GB of storage. Assuming the
        default overcommit rate of 16:1, working out the math provides
        an equation of:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>1600 = (16 &times; (number of physical cores)) / 2</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>storage required = 50&nbsp;GB &times; 1600</para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>On the surface, the equations reveal the need for 200
        physical cores and 80&nbsp;TB of storage for
        <filename>/var/lib/nova/instances/</filename>. However,
        it is also important to
        look at patterns of usage to estimate the load that the API
        services, database servers, and queue servers are likely to
        encounter.</para>
    <para>Consider, for example, the differences between a cloud that
        supports a managed web-hosting platform and one running
        integration tests for a development project that creates one
        instance per code commit. In the former, the heavy work of
        creating an instance happens only every few months, whereas
        the latter puts constant heavy load on the cloud controller.
        The average instance lifetime is significant, as a larger
        number generally means less load on the cloud
        controller.</para>
    <para>Aside from the creation and termination of instances, consider the
        impact of users accessing the service,
        particularly on nova-api and its associated database. Listing
        instances gathers a great deal of information and, given the
        frequency with which users run this operation, a cloud with a
        large number of users can increase the load significantly.
        This can even occur unintentionally. For example, the
        OpenStack Dashboard instances tab refreshes the list of
        instances every 30 seconds, so leaving it open in a browser
        window can cause unexpected load.</para>
    <para>Consideration of these factors can help determine how many
        cloud controller cores you require. A server with 8 CPU cores
        and 8 GB of RAM server would be sufficient for a rack of
        compute nodes, given the above caveats.</para>
    <para>Key hardware specifications are also crucial to the
        performance of user instances. Be sure to consider budget and
        performance needs, including storage performance
        (spindles/core), memory availability (RAM/core), network
        bandwidth (Gbps/core), and overall CPU performance
        (CPU/core).</para>
    <para>The cloud resource calculator is a useful tool in examining
        the impacts of different hardware and instance load outs. See:
        <link xlink:href="https://github.com/noslzzp/cloud-resource-calculator/blob/master/cloud-resource-calculator.ods">https://github.com/noslzzp/cloud-resource-calculator/blob/master/cloud-resource-calculator.ods</link>

    <section xml:id="expansion-planning-compute-focus">
        <title>Expansion planning</title>
    <para>A key challenge for planning the expansion of cloud
        compute services is the elastic nature of cloud infrastructure
        demands. Previously, new users or customers had to
        plan for and request the infrastructure they required ahead of
        time, allowing time for reactive procurement processes. Cloud
        computing users have come to expect the agility of having
        instant access to new resources as required.
        Consequently, plan for typical usage and for sudden bursts in
        usage.</para>
    <para>Planning for expansion is a balancing act.
        Planning too conservatively can lead to unexpected
        oversubscription of the cloud and dissatisfied users. Planning
        for cloud expansion too aggressively can lead to unexpected
        underutilization of the cloud and funds spent unnecessarily on operating
        infrastructure.</para>
    <para>The key is to carefully monitor the trends in
        cloud usage over time. The intent is to measure the
        consistency with which you deliver services, not the
        average speed or capacity of the cloud. Using this information
        to model capacity performance enables users to more
        accurately determine the current and future capacity of the
        cloud.</para></section>
    <section xml:id="cpu-and-ram-compute-focus"><title>CPU and RAM</title>
    <para>Adapted from:
        <link xlink:href="http://docs.openstack.org/openstack-ops/content/compute_nodes.html#cpu_choice">http://docs.openstack.org/openstack-ops/content/compute_nodes.html#cpu_choice</link></para>
    <para>In current generations, CPUs have up to 12 cores. If an
        Intel CPU supports Hyper-Threading, those 12 cores double
        to 24 cores. A server that supports multiple CPUs multiplies
        the number of available cores.
        Hyper-Threading is Intel's proprietary simultaneous
        multi-threading implementation, used to improve
        parallelization on their CPUs. Consider enabling
        Hyper-Threading to improve the performance of multithreaded
        applications.</para>
    <para>Whether the user should enable Hyper-Threading on a CPU
        depends on the use case. For example, disabling
        Hyper-Threading can be beneficial in intense computing
        environments. Running performance tests using local
        workloads with and without Hyper-Threading can help
        determine which option is more appropriate in any particular
        case.</para>
    <para>If they must run the Libvirt or KVM hypervisor drivers,
        then the compute node CPUs must support
        virtualization by way of the VT-x extensions for Intel chips
        and AMD-v extensions for AMD chips to provide full
        performance.</para>
    <para>OpenStack enables users to overcommit CPU and RAM on
        compute nodes. This allows an increase in the number of
        instances running on the cloud at the cost of reducing the
        performance of the instances. OpenStack Compute uses the
        following ratios by default:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>CPU allocation ratio: 16:1</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>RAM allocation ratio: 1.5:1</para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>The default CPU allocation ratio of 16:1 means that the
        scheduler allocates up to 16 virtual cores per physical core.
        For example, if a physical node has 12 cores, the scheduler
        sees 192 available virtual cores. With typical flavor
        definitions of 4 virtual cores per instance, this ratio would
        provide 48 instances on a physical node.</para>
    <para>Similarly, the default RAM allocation ratio of 1.5:1 means
        that the scheduler allocates instances to a physical node as
        long as the total amount of RAM associated with the instances
        is less than 1.5 times the amount of RAM available on the
        physical node.</para>
    <para>For example, if a physical node has 48 GB of RAM, the
        scheduler allocates instances to that node until the sum of
        the RAM associated with the instances reaches 72 GB (such as
        nine instances, in the case where each instance has 8 GB of
        RAM).</para>
    <para>You must select the appropriate CPU and RAM allocation ratio
        based on particular use cases.</para></section>
    <section xml:id="additional-hardware-compute-focus">
      <title>Additional hardware</title>
    <para>Certain use cases may benefit from exposure to additional
        devices on the compute node. Examples might include:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>High performance computing jobs that benefit from
                the availability of graphics processing units (GPUs)
                for general-purpose computing.</para>

    </itemizedlist>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>Cryptographic routines that benefit from the

        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Database management systems that benefit from the

                read/write time.</para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Host aggregates group hosts that share similar
        characteristics, which can include hardware similarities. The
        addition of specialized hardware to a cloud deployment is
        likely to add to the cost of each node, so consider carefully
        consideration whether all compute nodes, or
        just a subset targeted by flavors, need the
        additional customization to support the desired
        workloads.</para></section>
    <section xml:id="utilization"><title>Utilization</title>
    <para>Infrastructure-as-a-Service offerings, including OpenStack,
        use flavors to provide standardized views of virtual machine
        resource requirements that simplify the problem of scheduling
        instances while making the best use of the available physical
        resources.</para>
    <para>In order to facilitate packing of virtual machines onto
        physical hosts, the default selection of flavors provides a
        second largest flavor that is half the size
        of the largest flavor in every dimension. It has half the
        vCPUs, half the vRAM, and half the ephemeral disk space. The
        next largest flavor is half that size again. The following figure
        provides a visual representation of this concept for a general
        purpose computing design:
    <mediaobject>

    </mediaobject></para>
    <para>These default flavors are well suited to typical configurations
        of commodity server hardware. To maximize utilization,
        however, it may be necessary to customize the flavors or

    <section xml:id="security-compute-focus"><title>Security</title>
    <para>The security considerations for this scenario are
        similar to those of the other scenarios in this guide.</para>
    <para>A security domain comprises users, applications, servers,
        and networks that share common trust requirements and
        expectations within a system. Typically they have the same
        authentication and authorization requirements and
        users.</para>
    <para>These security domains are:</para>
    <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>Public</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Guest</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Management</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Data</para>
        </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>You can map these security domains individually to the
        installation, or combine them. For example, some
        deployment topologies combine both guest and data domains onto
        one physical network, whereas in other cases these networks
        are physically separate. In each case, the cloud operator
        should be aware of the appropriate security concerns. Map out
        security domains against specific OpenStack
        deployment topology. The domains and their trust requirements
        depend on whether the cloud instance is public, private, or
        hybrid.</para>
    <para>The public security domain is an untrusted area of
        the cloud infrastructure. It can refer to the Internet as a
        whole or simply to networks over which the user has no
        authority. Always consider this domain untrusted.</para>
    <para>Typically used for compute instance-to-instance traffic, the
        guest security domain handles compute data generated by
        instances on the cloud. It does not handle services that support the
        operation of the cloud, for example API calls. Public cloud
        providers and private cloud providers who do not have
        stringent controls on instance use or who allow unrestricted
        Internet access to instances should consider this an untrusted domain.
        Private cloud providers may want to consider this
        an internal network and therefore trusted only if they have
        controls in place to assert that they trust instances and all
        their tenants.</para>
    <para>The management security domain is where services interact.
        Sometimes referred to as the "control plane", the networks in
        this domain transport confidential data such as configuration
        parameters, user names, and passwords. In most deployments this
        is a trusted domain.</para>
    <para>The data security domain deals with
        information pertaining to the storage services within
        OpenStack. Much of the data that crosses this network has high
        integrity and confidentiality requirements and depending on
        the type of deployment there may also be strong availability
        requirements. The trust level of this network is heavily
        dependent on deployment decisions and as such we do not assign
        this a default level of trust.</para>
    <para>When deploying OpenStack in an enterprise as a private cloud, you can
        generally assume it is behind a firewall and within the trusted
        network alongside existing systems. Users of the cloud are
        typically employees or trusted individuals that are bound by
        the security requirements set forth by the company. This tends
        to push most of the security domains towards a more trusted
        model. However, when deploying OpenStack in a public-facing
        role, you cannot make these assumptions and the number of attack vectors
        significantly increases. For example, the API endpoints and the
        software behind it become vulnerable to hostile
        entities attempting to gain unauthorized access or prevent access
        to services. This can result in loss of reputation and you must
        protect against it through auditing and appropriate
        filtering.</para>
    <para>Take care when managing the users of the
        system, whether in public or private
        clouds. The identity service enables LDAP to be part of the
        authentication process, and includes such systems as an
        OpenStack deployment that may ease user management if
        integrated into existing systems.</para>
    <para>We recommend placing API services behind hardware that
        performs SSL termination. API services
        transmit user names, passwords, and generated tokens between
        client machines and API endpoints and therefore must be
        secure.</para>

      <title>OpenStack components</title>
    <para>Due to the nature of the workloads in this
