    <para>Increasing server density means sacrificing resource
        capacity or expandability, however, increasing resource
        capacity and expandability increases cost and decreases server
        density. As a result, determining the best server hardware for
        a general purpose OpenStack architecture means understanding
        how choice of form factor will impact the rest of the
        design. The following list outlines the form factors to
        choose from:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>Blade servers typically support dual-socket
                multi-core CPUs. Blades also offer
                outstanding density.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>1U rack-mounted servers occupy only a single rack
                unit. Their benefits include high density, support for
                dual-socket multi-core CPUs, and support for
                reasonable RAM amounts. This form factor offers
                limited storage capacity, limited network capacity,
                and limited expandability.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>2U rack-mounted servers offer the expanded storage
                and networking capacity that 1U servers tend to lack,
                but with a corresponding decrease in server density
                (half the density offered by 1U rack-mounted
                servers).</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Larger rack-mounted servers, such as 4U servers,
                will tend to offer even greater CPU capacity, often
                supporting four or even eight CPU sockets. These
                servers often have much greater expandability so will
                provide the best option for upgradability. This means,
                however, that the servers have a much lower server
                density and a much greater hardware cost.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Sled servers</emphasis> are rack-mounted servers that support
                multiple independent servers in a single 2U or 3U
                enclosure. This form factor offers increased density
                over typical 1U-2U rack-mounted servers but tends to
                suffer from limitations in the amount of storage or
                network capacity each individual server
                supports.</para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>The best form factor for server hardware
        supporting a general purpose OpenStack cloud is driven by
        outside business and cost factors. No single reference
        architecture applies to all implementations; the decision
        must flow from user requirements, technical
        considerations, and operational considerations. Here are some
        of the key factors that influence the selection of server
        hardware:</para>

                consideration for a general purpose OpenStack cloud.
                The expected or anticipated number of instances that
                each hypervisor can host is a common meter used in
                sizing the deployment. The selected server hardware
                needs to support the expected or anticipated instance
                density.</para>

            <para>Physical data centers have limited
                physical space, power, and cooling. The number of
                hosts (or hypervisors) that can be fitted into a given
                metric (rack, rack unit, or floor tile) is another
                important method of sizing. Floor weight is an often
                overlooked consideration. The data center floor must
                be able to support the weight of the proposed number
                of hosts within a rack or set of racks. These factors
                need to be applied as part of the host density
                calculation and server hardware selection.</para>

                as 20 AMPs per rack, while more recent data centers
                can be architected to support power densities as high
                as 120 AMP per rack. The selected server hardware must
                take power density into account.</para>

                architecture. Ensure that, at a minimum, there are at

        storage solution. Similarly, the network architecture impacts

                important. Hardware nodes selected for object storage
                should be capable of support a large number of inexpensive
                disks with no reliance on RAID controller cards.
                Hardware nodes selected for block storage should be capable

                cards to provide performance and redundancy to storage at a

            <para>To ensure that access to nodes within

                the network architecture identify any single points of
                failure and provide some level of redundancy or fault
                tolerance. With regard to the network infrastructure
                itself, this often involves use of networking
                protocols such as LACP, VRRP or others to achieve a
                highly available network connection. In addition, it
                is important to consider the networking implications
                on API availability. In order to ensure that the APIs,
                and potentially other services in the cloud are highly
                available, we recommend you design a load balancing
                solution within the network architecture to
                accommodate for these requirements.</para>

        It is important to research the component interdependencies
