    <title>Operational considerations</title>
    <para>Hybrid cloud deployments present complex operational
        challenges. Differences between provider clouds can cause
        incompatibilities with workloads or Cloud Management
        Platforms (CMP). Cloud providers may also offer different levels of
        integration with competing cloud offerings.</para>
    <para>Monitoring is critical to maintaining a hybrid cloud, and it is
        important to determine if a CMP supports
        monitoring of all the clouds involved, or if compatible APIs
        are available to be queried for necessary information.</para>

    <section xml:id="agility">
      <title>Agility</title>
    <para>Hybrid clouds provide application
        availability across different cloud environments and
        technologies. This availability enables the deployment to
        survive disaster in any single cloud environment.
        Each cloud should provide the means to create instances quickly
        in response to capacity issues or failure elsewhere in the hybrid
        cloud.</para>

    <section xml:id="application-readiness-hybrid">
      <title>Application readiness</title>
    <para>Enterprise workloads that depend on the
        underlying infrastructure for availability are not designed to
        run on OpenStack. If the application cannot
        tolerate infrastructure failures, it is likely to require
        significant operator intervention to recover. Applications for
        hybrid clouds must be fault tolerant, with an SLA that is not tied
        to the underlying infrastructure. Ideally, cloud applications should be
        able to recover when entire racks and data centers experience an
        outage.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="upgrades">
      <title>Upgrades</title>
    <para>If a deployment includes a public cloud, predicting
        upgrades may not be possible. Carefully examine provider SLAs.</para>
      <note>
        <para>At massive scale, even when
        dealing with a cloud that offers an SLA with a high percentage
        of uptime, workloads must be able to recover quickly.</para>
      </note>
    <para>When upgrading private cloud deployments, minimize disruption by
        making incremental changes and providing a facility to either rollback
        or continue to roll forward when using a continuous delivery
        model.</para>
    <para>You may need to coordinate CMP upgrades with hybrid cloud upgrades if
        there are API changes.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="network-operation-center-noc">
      <title>Network Operation Center</title>
    <para>Consider infrastructure control
        when planning the Network Operation Center (NOC)
        for a hybrid cloud environment. If a significant
        portion of the cloud is on externally managed systems,
        prepare for situations where it may not be possible to
        make changes.
        Additionally, providers may differ on how
        infrastructure must be managed and exposed. This can lead to
        delays in root cause analysis where each insists the blame
        lies with the other provider.</para>
    <para>Ensure that the network structure connects all clouds to form
        integrated system, keeping in mind the state of handoffs.
        These handoffs must both be as reliable as possible and
        include as little latency as possible to ensure the best
        performance of the overall system.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="maintainability">
      <title>Maintainability</title>
    <para>Hybrid clouds rely on third party systems and processes. As a
        result, it is not possible to guarantee
        proper maintenance of the overall system. Instead, be prepared to
        abandon workloads and recreate them in an improved state.</para>
