    <title>How this book is organized</title>
    <para>This book examines some of the most common uses for OpenStack
      clouds, and explains the considerations for each use case.
      Cloud architects may use this book as a comprehensive guide by
      reading all of the use cases, but it is also possible to review
      only the chapters which pertain to a specific use case.
      The use cases covered in this guide include:</para>
