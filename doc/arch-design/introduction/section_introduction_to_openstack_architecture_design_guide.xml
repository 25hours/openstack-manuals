    <title>Introduction to the OpenStack Architecture Design
        Guide</title>
    <para>OpenStack is a leader in the cloud technology gold rush, as
        organizations of all stripes discover the increased
        flexibility and speed to market that self-service cloud and
        Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides. To truly reap
        those benefits, however, the cloud must be designed and
        architected properly.</para>
    <para>A well-architected cloud provides a stable IT environment
        that offers easy access to needed resources, usage-based
        expenses, extra capacity on demand, disaster recovery, and a
        secure environment, but a well-architected cloud does not
        magically build itself. It requires careful consideration of a
        multitude of factors, both technical and non-technical.</para>
    <para>There is no single architecture that is "right" for an
        OpenStack cloud deployment. OpenStack can be used for any
        number of different purposes, and each of them has its own
        particular requirements and architectural
        peculiarities.</para>
    <para>This book is designed to look at some of the most common
        uses for OpenStack clouds (and even some that are less common,
        but provide a good example) and explain what issues need to be
        considered and why, along with a wealth of knowledge and
        advice to help an organization to design and build a
        well-architected OpenStack cloud that will fit its unique
        requirements.</para>
