    <para>Multi-site OpenStack cloud deployment using regions
        requires that the service catalog contains per-region entries
        for each service deployed other than the Identity service. Most
        off-the-shelf OpenStack deployment tools have limited support
        for defining multiple regions in this fashion.</para>
    <para>Deployers should be aware of this and provide the appropriate
        customization of the service catalog for their site either
        manually, or by customizing deployment tools in use.</para>
    <note><para>As of the Kilo release, documentation for
        implementing this feature is in progress. See this bug for
        more information:

      <title>Licensing</title>
    <para>Multi-site OpenStack deployments present additional
        licensing considerations over and above regular OpenStack
        clouds, particularly where site licenses are in use to provide
        cost efficient access to software licenses. The licensing for
        host operating systems, guest operating systems, OpenStack
        distributions (if applicable), software-defined infrastructure
        including network controllers and storage systems, and even
        individual applications need to be evaluated.</para>

    <para>Logging and monitoring does not significantly differ for a

      <title>Upgrades</title>
    <para>In multi-site OpenStack clouds deployed using regions, sites
        are independent OpenStack installations which are linked
        together using shared centralized services such as OpenStack
        Identity. At a high level the recommended order of operations
        to upgrade an individual OpenStack environment is (see the <link

    <para>Compute upgrades within each site can also be performed in a rolling
        fashion. Compute controller services (API, Scheduler, and
        Conductor) can be upgraded prior to upgrading of individual
        compute nodes. This allows operations staff to keep a site
        operational for users of Compute services while performing an
        upgrade.</para></section>
    <section xml:id="quota-management-multi-site">
      <title>Quota management</title>
      <para>Quotas are used to set operational limits to prevent system
        capacities from being exhausted without notification. They are
        currently enforced at the tenant (or project) level rather than
        at the user level.</para>
      <para>Quotas are defined on a per-region basis. Operators can
        define identical quotas for tenants in each region of the
        cloud to provide a consistent experience, or even create a
        process for synchronizing allocated quotas across regions. It
        is important to note that only the operational limits imposed
        by the quotas will be aligned consumption of quotas by users
        will not be reflected between regions.</para>
    <para>For example, given a cloud with two regions, if the operator
        grants a user a quota of 25 instances in each region then that
        user may launch a total of 50 instances spread across both
        regions. They may not, however, launch more than 25 instances
        in any single region.</para>
    <para>For more information on managing quotas refer to the
        <link
        xlink:href="http://docs.openstack.org/openstack-ops/content/projects_users.html">Managing
        projects and users chapter</link> of the <citetitle>OpenStack
        Operators Guide</citetitle>.</para>

    <section xml:id="policy-management-multi-site">
      <title>Policy management</title>
    <para>OpenStack provides a default set of Role Based Access
        Control (RBAC) policies, defined in a <filename>policy.json</filename> file, for
        each service. Operators edit these files to customize the
        policies for their OpenStack installation. If the application
        of consistent RBAC policies across sites is a requirement, then
        it is necessary to ensure proper synchronization of the
        <filename>policy.json</filename> files to all installations.</para>
    <para>This must be done using system administration tools
        such as rsync as functionality for synchronizing policies
        across regions is not currently provided within OpenStack.</para></section>
    <section xml:id="documentation-multi-site">
      <title>Documentation</title>
    <para>Users must be able to leverage cloud infrastructure and
        provision new resources in the environment. It is important
        that user documentation is accessible by users to ensure they
        are given sufficient information to help them leverage the cloud.
        As an example, by default OpenStack schedules instances on a compute node
        automatically. However, when multiple regions are available,
        the end user needs to decide in which region to schedule the
        new instance. The dashboard presents the user with
        the first region in your configuration. The API and CLI tools
        do not execute commands unless a valid region is specified.
        It is therefore important to provide documentation to your
        users describing the region layout as well as calling out that
        quotas are region-specific. If a user reaches his or her quota
        in one region, OpenStack does not automatically build new
        instances in another. Documenting specific examples helps
        users understand how to operate the cloud, thereby reducing
        calls and tickets filed with the help desk.</para></section>
