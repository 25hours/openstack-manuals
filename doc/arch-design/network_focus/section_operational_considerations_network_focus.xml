    <title>Operational considerations</title>
    <para>Network-focused OpenStack clouds have a number of operational
      considerations that influence the selected design, including:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Dynamic routing of static routes</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Service level agreements (SLAs)</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Ownership of user management</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>An initial network consideration is the selection of a telecom
      company or transit provider.</para>
    <para>Make additional design decisions about monitoring and alarming.
      This can be an internal responsibility or the responsibility of the
      external provider. In the case of using an external provider, service
      level agreements (SLAs) likely apply. In addition, other operational
      considerations such as bandwidth, latency, and jitter can be part of an
      SLA.</para>
    <para>Consider the ability to upgrade the infrastructure. As demand for
      network resources increase, operators add additional IP address blocks
      and add additional bandwidth capacity. In addition, consider managing
      hardware and software life cycle events, for example upgrades,
      decommissioning, and outages, while avoiding service interruptions for
      tenants.</para>
    <para>Factor maintainability into the overall network design. This
      includes the ability to manage and maintain IP addresses as well as the
      use of overlay identifiers including VLAN tag IDs, GRE tunnel IDs, and
      MPLS tags. As an example, if you may need to change all of the IP
      addresses on a network, a process known as renumbering, then the design
      must support this function.</para>
    <para>Address network-focused applications when considering certain
      operational realities. For example, consider the impending exhaustion
      of IPv4 addresses, the migration to IPv6, and the use of private
      networks to segregate different types of traffic that an application
      receives or generates. In the case of IPv4 to IPv6 migrations,
      applications should follow best practices for storing IP addresses.
      We recommend you avoid relying on IPv4 features that did not carry over
      to the IPv6 protocol or have differences in implementation.</para>
    <para>To segregate traffic, allow applications to create a private tenant
      network for database and storage network traffic. Use a public network
      for services that require direct client access from the internet. Upon
      segregating the traffic, consider quality of service (QoS) and security
      to ensure each network has the required level of service.</para>
    <para>Finally, consider the routing of network traffic.
      For some applications, develop a complex policy framework for
      routing. To create a routing policy that satisfies business requirements,
      consider the economic cost of transmitting traffic over expensive links
      versus cheaper links, in addition to bandwidth, latency, and jitter
      requirements.</para>
    <para>Additionally, consider how to respond to network events. As an
      example, how load transfers from one link to another during a
      failure scenario could be a factor in the design. If you do not plan
      network capacity correctly, failover traffic could overwhelm other ports
      or network links and create a cascading failure scenario. In this case,
      traffic that fails over to one link overwhelms that link and then moves
      to the subsequent links until all network traffic stops.</para>
