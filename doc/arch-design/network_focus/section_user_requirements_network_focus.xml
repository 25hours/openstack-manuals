    <para>Network-focused architectures vary from the general-purpose
      architecture designs. Certain network-intensive applications influence
      these architectures. Some of the business requirements that influence
      the design include:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>Network latency through slow page loads, degraded video
              streams, and low quality VoIP sessions impacts the user
              experience. Users are often not aware of how network design and
              architecture affects their experiences. Both enterprise customers
              and end-users rely on the network for delivery of an application.
              Network performance problems can result in a negative experience
              for the end-user, as well as productivity and economic loss.

      <title>High availability issues</title>
      <para>Depending on the application and use case, network-intensive
        OpenStack installations can have high availability requirements.
        Financial transaction systems have a much higher requirement for high
        availability than a development application. Use network availability
        technologies, for example quality of service (QoS), to improve the
        network performance of sensitive applications such as VoIP and video
        streaming.</para>
      <para>High performance systems have SLA requirements for a minimum
        QoS with regard to guaranteed uptime, latency, and bandwidth. The level
        of the SLA can have a significant impact on the network architecture and
        requirements for redundancy in the systems.</para>

              layers. If there is a single point of failure due to only one

            <para>An overly complex network design can be difficult to
              maintain and troubleshoot. While device-level configuration
              can ease maintenance concerns and automated tools can handle
              overlay networks, avoid or document non-traditional interconnects
              between functions and specialized hardware to prevent
              outages.</para>

          <term>Non-standard features</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>There are additional risks that arise from configuring the
              cloud network to take advantage of vendor specific features.
              One example is multi-link aggregation (MLAG) used to provide
              redundancy at the aggregator switch level of the network. MLAG
              is not a standard and, as a result, each vendor has their own
              proprietary implementation of the feature. MLAG architectures
              are not interoperable across switch vendors, which leads to
              vendor lock-in, and can cause delays or inability when upgrading
              components.</para>
