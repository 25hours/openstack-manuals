  <title>Specialized hardware</title>
  <para>Certain workloads require specialized hardware devices that
    are either difficult to virtualize or impossible to share.
    Applications such as load balancers, highly parallel brute
    force computing, and direct to wire networking may need
    capabilities that basic OpenStack components do not
    provide.</para>

    <para>Some applications need access to hardware devices to either
    improve performance or provide capabilities that are not
    virtual CPU, RAM, network, or storage. These can be a shared
    resource, such as a cryptography processor, or a dedicated
    resource, such as a Graphics Processing Unit. OpenStack can
    provide some of these, while others may need extra
    work.</para>

    <para>To provide cryptography offloading to a set of
    instances, you can use Image Service configuration
    options to assign the cryptography chip to a device node in
    the guest. The <citetitle>OpenStack Command Line
    Reference</citetitle> contains further information on
    configuring this solution in the chapter <link
    xlink:href="http://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/content/chapter_cli-glance-property.html">
    Image Service property keys</link>, but it allows all
    guests using the configured images to access the hypervisor
    cryptography device.</para>
    <para>If you require direct access to a specific device, PCI
    pass-through enables you to dedicate the device to a single
    instance per hypervisor. You must define a flavor that
    has the PCI device specifically in order to properly schedule
    instances. More information regarding PCI pass-through,
    including instructions for implementing and
    using it, is available at <link
