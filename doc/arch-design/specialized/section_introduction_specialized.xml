    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>Although most OpenStack architecture designs fall into one
        of the seven major scenarios outlined in other sections
        (compute focused, network focused, storage focused, general
        purpose, multi-site, hybrid cloud, and massively scalable),
        there are a few other use cases that are unique enough they
        can't be neatly categorized into one of the other major
        sections. This section discusses some of these unique use
        cases with some additional details and design considerations
        for each use case:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>Specialized Networking: This describes running
                networking-oriented software that may involve reading
                packets directly from the wire or participating in
                routing protocols.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Software-Defined Networking: This use case details
                both running an SDN controller from within OpenStack
                as well as participating in a software-defined
                network.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Desktop-as-a-Service: This is for organizations that
                want to run a virtualized desktop environment on a
                cloud. This can apply to private or public
                clouds.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>OpenStack on OpenStack: Some organizations are
                finding that it makes technical sense to build a
                multi-tiered cloud by running OpenStack on top of an
                OpenStack installation.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Specialized Hardware: Some highly specialized
                situations will require the use of specialized
                hardware devices from within the OpenStack
                environment.</para>
