    <para>Some applications that interact with a network require more
        specialized connectivity. Applications such as a looking glass
        require the ability to connect to a BGP peer, or route
        participant applications may need to join a network at a layer
        2 level.</para>

    <para>Connecting specialized network applications to their
        required resources alters the design of an OpenStack
        installation. Installations that rely on overlay networks are
        unable to support a routing participant, and may also block
        layer 2 listeners.</para></section>

    <para>Deploying an OpenStack installation using Neutron with a
        provider network will allow direct layer 2 connectivity to an
        upstream networking device. This design provides the layer 2
        connectivity required to communicate via Intermediate
        System-to-Intermediate System (ISIS) protocol or to pass
        packets controlled via an OpenFlow controller. Using the
        multiple layer 2 plug-in with an agent such as Open vSwitch
        would allow a private connection through a VLAN directly to a
        specific port in a layer 3 device. This would allow a BGP
        point to point link to exist that will join the autonomous
        system. Avoid using layer 3 plug-ins as they will divide the
        broadcast domain and prevent router adjacencies from
        forming.</para></section>
