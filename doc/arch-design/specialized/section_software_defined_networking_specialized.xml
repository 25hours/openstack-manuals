  <title>Software-defined networking</title>
  <para>Software-defined networking (SDN) is the separation of the data
    plane and control plane. SDN is a popular method of
    managing and controlling packet flows within networks. SDN
    uses overlays or directly controlled layer-2 devices to
    determine flow paths, and as such presents challenges to a
    cloud environment. Some designers may wish to run their
    controllers within an OpenStack installation. Others may wish
    to have their installations participate in an SDN-controlled
    network.</para>

    <title>Challenges</title>
    <para>SDN is a relatively new concept that is not yet
    standardized, so SDN systems come in a variety of different
    implementations. Because of this, a truly prescriptive
    architecture is not feasible. Instead, examine the differences
    between an existing and a planned OpenStack design and determine
    where potential conflicts and gaps exist.</para>

    <title>Possible solutions</title>
    <para>If an SDN implementation requires layer-2 access because it
      directly manipulates switches, we do not recommend running an
      overlay network or a layer-3 agent. If the controller
      resides within an OpenStack installation, it may be necessary
      to build an ML2 plug-in and schedule the controller instances
      to connect to tenant VLANs that then talk directly to the
      switch hardware. Alternatively, depending on the external
      device support, use a tunnel that terminates at the switch
      hardware itself.</para>
