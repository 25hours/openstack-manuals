    <title>Architecture</title>
    <para>There are three areas to consider when selecting storage hardware:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>Cost</para>
        </listitem>

    <para>Storage-focused OpenStack clouds must reflect that the workloads are storage
        intensive. These workloads are not compute intensive, nor are
        they consistently network intensive. The network may be
        heavily utilized to transfer storage, but they are not
        otherwise network intensive.</para>
    <para>For a storage-focused OpenStack design architecture, the
        selection of storage hardware will determine the overall
        performance and scalability of the design architecture. A
        number of different factors must be considered in the design
        process:</para>
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Cost</term>
        <listitem>
            <para>The cost of components can change which storage
                architecture and hardware you choose.</para>

      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Performance</term>
        <listitem>
            <para>Performance is measured by observing the latency of
                storage I/O requests. Performance requirements can change
                which solution is implemented.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Scalability</term>
        <listitem>
            <para>Scalability refers to how well the
                storage solution performs as it is expanded up to its
                maximum size. Storage solutions that perform well in
                small configurations but have degraded performance
                would not be considered scalable.
                However, a solution that continues to perform well
                at maximum expansion would be considered scalable. The
                ability of the storage solution to continue to perform
                well as it expands is important.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Expandability</term>
        <listitem>
            <para>Expandability is the overall
                ability of the solution to grow. A storage solution
                that expands to 50 PB is considered more expandable
                than a solution that only scales to 10 PB.</para>
              <note>
                <para>This metric is related to but different from
                scalability which is a measure of the solution's
                performance as it expands.
                </para>
              </note>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
    <para>Latency is one of the key considerations in a
        storage-focused OpenStack cloud. Using solid-state disks
        (SSDs) to minimize latency for instance storage, and reduce
        CPU delays caused by waiting for the storage, will increase
        performance. We recommend evaluating the
        gains from using RAID controller cards in compute hosts to
        improve the performance of the underlying disk
        subsystem.</para>
    <para>The selection of storage architecture determines if a scale-out
        solution should be used or if a single, highly expandable and
        scalable centralized storage array would be a better choice.
        If a centralized storage array is the right fit for the requirements
        then the hardware will be determined by the array vendor. It is possible
        to build a storage array using commodity hardware with Open Source
        software, but there needs to be access to people with expertise
        to build such a system.</para>
    <para>On the other hand, a scale-out storage solution that
        uses direct-attached storage (DAS) in the servers may be an
        appropriate choice. If this is true, then the server hardware
        needs to be configured to support the storage solution.</para>
    <para>Some potential impacts that might affect a particular
        storage architecture (and corresponding storage hardware) of a
        Storage-focused OpenStack cloud:</para>

        <listitem>
            <para>Based on the storage solution
                selected, ensure the connectivity matches the storage
                solution requirements. If a centralized storage array
                is selected, it is important to determine how the
                hypervisors will connect to the storage array.
                Connectivity can affect latency and thus performance.
                We recommended you check that the network
                characteristics will minimize latency to boost the
                overall performance of the design.</para>

    <para>Compute (server) hardware must be evaluated against four
        opposing dimensions:</para>
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Server density</term>
        <listitem>
            <para>A measure of how many servers can
                fit into a given measure of physical space, such as a
                rack unit [U].</para>

      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Resource capacity</term>
        <listitem>
            <para>The number of CPU cores, how much
                RAM, or how much storage a given server will
                deliver.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Expandability</term>
        <listitem>
            <para>The number of additional resources
                that can be added to a server before it has reached
                its limit.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Cost</term>
        <listitem>
            <para>The relative of the hardware weighted against
                the level of design effort needed to build the
                system.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
    <para>The dimensions need to be weighed against each other to
        determine the best design for the desired purpose. For
        example, increasing server density can mean sacrificing
        resource capacity or expandability. Increasing resource
        capacity and expandability can increase cost but decrease
        server density. Decreasing cost often means decreasing
        supportability, server density, resource capacity, and
        expandability.</para>
    <para>Compute capacity (CPU cores and RAM capacity) is a secondary
        consideration for selecting server hardware. As
        a result, the required server hardware must supply adequate
        CPU sockets, additional CPU cores, and more RAM; network
        connectivity and storage capacity are not as critical. The
        hardware will need to provide enough network connectivity and
        storage capacity to meet the user requirements, however they
        are not the primary consideration.</para>
    <para>Some server hardware form factors are better
        suited to storage-focused designs than others. The following is
        a list of these form factors:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>Most blade servers typically support dual-socket
                multi-core CPUs. Choose either full width or full height
                blades to avoid the limit. High density blade servers
                support up to 16 servers in only 10
                rack units using half height or half width blades.</para>
              <warning>
                <para>This decreases density by 50% (only 8 servers
                in 10 U) if a full width or full height option is used.
                </para>
              </warning>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>1U rack-mounted servers have the ability to offer greater
               server density than a blade server solution, but are often
               limited to dual-socket, multi-core CPU configurations.</para>
              <note>
                <para>As of the Icehouse release, neither HP, IBM,
                nor Dell offered 1U rack servers with more than 2 CPU
                sockets.
                </para>
              </note>
            <para>To obtain greater than dual-socket support in
                a 1U rack-mount form factor, customers need to buy
                their systems from Original Design Manufacturers
                (ODMs) or second-tier manufacturers.</para>
              <warning>
                <para>This may cause issues for organizations that have
                preferred vendor policies or concerns with support and hardware
                warranties of non-tier 1 vendors.
                </para>
              </warning>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>2U rack-mounted servers provide quad-socket,
                multi-core CPU support but with a corresponding
                decrease in server density (half the density offered
                by 1U rack-mounted servers).</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Larger rack-mounted servers, such as 4U servers,
                often provide even greater CPU capacity. Commonly
                supporting four or even eight CPU sockets. These
                servers have greater expandability capacity but such
                servers have much lower server density and usually
                greater hardware cost.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Rack-mounted servers
                that support multiple independent servers in a single
                2U or 3U enclosure, "sled servers", deliver increased density as
                compared to a typical 1U-2U rack-mounted servers.</para>
            <para>For example, many sled servers offer four independent
                dual-socket nodes in 2U for a total of 8 CPU sockets
                in 2U. However, the dual-socket limitation on
                individual nodes may not be sufficient to offset their
                additional cost and configuration complexity.</para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Other factors will strongly influence server hardware
        selection for a storage-focused OpenStack design
        architecture. The following is a list of these factors:</para>
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Instance density</term>
        <listitem>
            <para>In this architecture, instance
                density and CPU-RAM oversubscription are lower. More
                hosts will be required to support the anticipated
                scale, especially if the design uses dual-socket
                hardware designs.</para>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Host density</term>
        <listitem>
            <para>Another option to address the higher
                host count is to use a quad socket platform. Taking
                this approach will decrease host density which also
                increases rack count. This configuration affects the
                number of power connections and also impacts network
                and cooling requirements.</para>

      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Power and cooling density</term>
        <listitem>
            <para>The power and cooling
                density requirements might be lower than with blade,
                sled, or 1U server designs due to lower host density
                (by using 2U, 3U or even 4U server designs). For data
                centers with older infrastructure, this might be a
                desirable feature.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
    <para>Storage-focused OpenStack design architecture server
        hardware selection should focus on a "scale up" versus "scale
        out" solution. The determination of which will be the best
        solution, a smaller number of larger hosts or a larger number of
        smaller hosts, will depend on a combination of factors
        including cost, power, cooling, physical rack and floor space,
        support-warranty, and manageability.</para>

        <title>Networking hardware selection</title>
    <para>Some of the key considerations that should be included in
        the selection of networking hardware include:</para>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Port density</term>
        <listitem>
            <para>The network design will be affected by
                the physical space that is required to provide the
                requisite port count. A switch that can provide 48 10&nbsp;GbE
                ports in 1U has a much higher port density than a
                switch that provides 24 10&nbsp;GbE ports in 2U. On a
                general scale, a higher port density leaves more rack
                space for compute or storage components which is
                preferred. It is also important to consider fault
                domains and power density. Finally, higher density
                switches are more expensive, therefore it is important
                not to over design the network.</para>

                The cost of training should be considered when choosing
                the solution. The support of a commercial product
                such as Red Hat, SUSE, or Windows, is the
                responsibility of the OS vendor. If an open source
                platform is chosen, the support comes from in-house
                resources.</para>

      <title>OpenStack components</title>
    <para>Which OpenStack components you choose can have a significant
        impact on the overall design. While there are certain
        components that will always be present, (Compute and Image Service, for
        example) there are other services that may not need to be
        present. As an example, a certain design may not require
        the Orchestration module. Omitting Orchestration would not typically have a
        significant impact on the overall design, however, if the
        architecture uses a replacement for OpenStack Object Storage for its
        storage component, this could potentially have significant
        impacts on the rest of the design.</para>
    <para>A storage-focused design might require the ability to use
        Orchestration to launch instances with Block Storage volumes to perform
        storage-intensive processing.</para>
    <para>For a storage-focused OpenStack design architecture, the
        following components would typically be used:</para>

    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Excluding certain OpenStack components may limit or
        constrain the functionality of other components. If a design
        opts to include Orchestration but exclude Telemetry, then the design
        will not be able to take advantage of Orchestration's auto scaling
        functionality (which relies on information from Telemetry).
        Due to the fact that you can use Orchestration to spin up a large
        number of instances to perform the compute-intensive
        processing, including Orchestration in a compute-focused architecture
        design is strongly recommended.</para>

    <para>Clustering Software, such as Corosync or Pacemaker, is
        determined primarily by the availability design requirements.
        The impact of including (or not including) these
        software packages is determined by the availability of the
        cloud infrastructure and the complexity of supporting the
        configuration after it is deployed. The <citetitle>OpenStack High
        Availability Guide</citetitle> provides more details on the installation
        and configuration of Corosync and Pacemaker, should these
        packages need to be included in the design.</para>
    <para>Requirements for logging, monitoring, and alerting are
        determined by operational considerations. Each of these
        sub-categories includes a number of various options. For
        example, in the logging sub-category one might consider
        Logstash, Splunk, Log Insight, or another log
        aggregation-consolidation tool. Logs should be stored in a
        centralized location to make it easier to perform analytics
        against the data. Log data analytics engines can also provide
        automation and issue notification, by providing a mechanism to
        both alert and automatically attempt to remediate some of the
        more commonly known issues.</para>
    <para>If any of these software packages are needed, then the
        design must account for the additional resource consumption
        (CPU, RAM, storage, and network bandwidth for a log
        aggregation solution, for example). Some other potential
