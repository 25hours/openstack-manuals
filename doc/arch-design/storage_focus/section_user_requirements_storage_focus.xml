    <para>Storage-focused clouds are defined by their requirements for
        data. These include:</para>

            <para>The user pays only for the storage they
                actually use. This limit typically reflects average
                user consumption during a month. This does not mean
                that cloud storage is less expensive, only that it
                incurs operating expenses rather than capital expenses.</para>
