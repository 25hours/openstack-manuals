    <title>Community Support</title>
    <para>Many OpenStack community members can answer questions and
        help with bug suspicions. We are constantly improving and
        adding to the main features of OpenStack, but if you have any
        problems, do not hesitate to ask. Use the following resources
        to get OpenStack support and troubleshoot your existing
        installations.</para>

        <title>ask.openstack.org</title>
        <para>During set up or testing, you might have questions about
how to do something or be in a situation where a feature
does not work correctly. Use the <link
    xlink:href="ask.openstack.org"
    >ask.openstack.org</link> site to ask questions and
get answers. When you visit the <link
    xlink:href="http://ask.openstack.org"
    >http://ask.openstack.org</link> site, scan the recently asked questions to see whether
your question was already answered. If not, ask a new question. Be sure
to give a clear, concise summary in the title and provide
as much detail as possible in the description. Paste in
your command output or stack traces, link to screen shots,
and so on.</para>

        <title>OpenStack mailing lists</title>
        <para>A great way to get answers and insights is to post your
            question or scenario to the OpenStack mailing list. You
            can learn from and help others who might have the same
            scenario as you. To subscribe or view the archives, go to
                <link
                xlink:href="http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack"
                >http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack</link>.
            You might be interested in the other mailing lists for
            specific projects or development, which you can find <link
                xlink:href="http://wiki.openstack.org/MailingLists">on
                the wiki</link>. A description of all mailing lists is
            available at <link
                xlink:href="http://wiki.openstack.org/MailingLists"
                >http://wiki.openstack.org/MailingLists</link>.</para>

        <title>The OpenStack Wiki search</title>
        <para>The <link xlink:href="http://wiki.openstack.org/"
                >OpenStack wiki</link> contains content on a broad
            range of topics but some of it sits a bit below the
            surface. Fortunately, the wiki search feature enables you
            to search by title or content. If you search for specific
            information, such as about networking or nova, you can
            find lots of content. More is being added all the time, so
            be sure to check back often. You can find the search box
            in the upper right corner of any OpenStack wiki
            page.</para>

        <title>The Launchpad Bugs area</title>
        <para>So you think you've found a bug. That's great!
            Seriously, it is. The OpenStack community values your set
            up and testing efforts and wants your feedback. To log a
            bug, you must sign up for a Launchpad account at <link
                xlink:href="https://launchpad.net/+login"
                >https://launchpad.net/+login</link>. You can view
            existing bugs and report bugs in the Launchpad Bugs area.
            Use the search feature to determine whether the bug was
            already reported (or even better, already fixed). If it
            still seems like your bug is unreported, fill out a bug
            report.</para>

        <title>The OpenStack IRC channel</title>
        <para>The OpenStack community lives and breathes in the
            #openstack IRC channel on the Freenode network. You can
            come by to hang out, ask questions, or get immediate
            feedback for urgent and pressing issues. To get into the
            IRC channel, you must install an IRC client or use a
            browser-based client by going to <link
                xlink:href="http://webchat.freenode.net"
                >http://webchat.freenode.net/</link>. You can also use
            Colloquy (Mac OS X, <link
                xlink:href="http://colloquy.info/"
                >http://colloquy.info/</link>), mIRC (Windows, <link
                xlink:href="http://www.mirc.com/"
                >http://www.mirc.com/</link>), or XChat (Linux). When
            you are in the IRC channel and want to share code or
            command output, the generally accepted method is to use a
            Paste Bin. The OpenStack project has one at <link
                xlink:href="http://paste.openstack.org"
                >http://paste.openstack.org</link>. Just paste your
            longer amounts of text or logs in the web form and you get
            a URL you can paste into the channel. The OpenStack IRC
            channel is: <literal>#openstack</literal> on
                <literal>irc.freenode.net</literal>. You can find a
            list of all OpenStack-related IRC channels at <link
                xlink:href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/IRC"
                >https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/IRC</link>.</para>
