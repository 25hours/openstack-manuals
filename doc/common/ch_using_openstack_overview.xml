    <para audience="enduser">As an OpenStack cloud end user, you can provision your own resources
        within the limits set by administrators.</para>
    <para audience="adminuser">As an OpenStack cloud administrative user, you can manage tenants,
        known as <glossterm baseform="project">projects</glossterm>, users, services, images,
        flavors, and quotas.</para>
    <para>The examples in this guide show you how to perform tasks by using the following
        methods:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>OpenStack dashboard. Use this web-based graphical interface, code named <link
                    xlink:href="https://github.com/openstack/horizon/">horizon</link>, to view,
                create, and manage resources<phrase audience="adminuser"> and
                services</phrase>.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>OpenStack command-line clients. Each core OpenStack project has a command-line
                client that you can use to run simple commands to view, create, and manage
                    resources<phrase audience="adminuser"> and services</phrase> in a cloud and
                automate tasks by using scripts.</para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>You can modify these examples for your specific use cases.</para>
    <para>In addition to these ways of interacting with a cloud, you can access the OpenStack APIs
        directly or indirectly through <link xlink:href="http://curl.haxx.se/">cURL</link> commands
        or open SDKs. You can automate access or build tools to manage resources and services by
        using the native OpenStack APIs or the EC2 compatibility API.</para>
    <para>To use the OpenStack APIs, it helps to be familiar with HTTP/1.1, RESTful web services,
        the OpenStack services, and JSON or XML data serialization formats.</para>

        <title>Who should read this book?</title>
        <para audience="enduser">This book is written for anyone who uses virtual machines and cloud
            resources to develop software or perform research. You should have years of experience
            with Linux-based tool sets and be comfortable using both GUI and CLI based tools. While
            this book includes some information about using Python to create and manage cloud
            resources, Python knowledge is not a pre-requisite for reading this book.</para>
        <para audience="adminuser">This book is written for administrators who maintain and secure
            an OpenStack cloud installation to serve end users' needs. You should have years of
            experience with Linux-based tools for system administration. You should also be familiar
            with OpenStack basics, such as managing projects and users, troubleshooting, performing
            backup and recovery, and monitoring. For more information, see the <link
