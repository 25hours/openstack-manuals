    <title>Introduction to Object Storage</title>
    <para>Object Storage is a scalable object storage system - it is
        not a file system in the traditional sense. You cannot mount
        this system like traditional SAN or NAS volumes. Because Object
        Storage requires a different way of thinking when it comes to
        storage, take a few moments to review the key concepts in the
        developer documentation at <link
