    <title>Create and source the OpenStack RC file</title>
    <para>To set the required environment variables for the OpenStack
        command-line clients, you must either create or download an
        environment file, and source it. It is project-specific and
        contains the credentials used by all OpenStack
        services.</para>
    <para>When you source the file, environment variables are set for
        your current shell. They allow the commands to communicate to
        the OpenStack services that run in the cloud.</para>
    <para>If your OpenStack installation provides it, you can download
        the file from the OpenStack dashboard as an administrative
        user or any other user.</para>
    <procedure>
        <step>
            <para>Log in to the OpenStack dashboard, choose the
                project for which you want to download the OpenStack
                RC file, and click <guibutton>Access &amp;
                    Security</guibutton>.</para>
        </step>
        <step>
            <para>Click <guibutton>Download OpenStack RC
                    File</guibutton> and save the file.</para>
        </step>
        <step>
            <para>Copy the <filename>openrc.sh</filename> file to the
                machine from where you want to run OpenStack
                commands.</para>
            <para>For example, copy the file to the machine from where
                you want to upload an image with a glance client
                command.</para>
        </step>
        <step>
            <para>On any shell from where you want to run OpenStack
                commands, source the <filename>openrc.sh</filename>
                file for the respective project.</para>
            <para>In this example, you source the
                    <filename>demo-openrc.sh</filename> file for the
                demo project:</para>
            <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>source demo-openrc.sh</userinput></screen>
        </step>
        <step>
            <para>When you are prompted for an OpenStack password,
                enter the password for the user who downloaded the
                    <filename>openrc.sh</filename> file.</para>
        </step>
        <step>
            <para>When you run OpenStack client commands, you can
                override some environment variable settings by using
                the options that are listed at the end of the
                    <command>nova help</command> output. For example,
                you can override the <literal>OS_PASSWORD</literal>
                setting in the <filename>openrc.sh</filename> file by
                specifying a password on a nova command, as
                follows:</para>
            <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>nova --password &lt;password> image-list</userinput></screen>
            <para>Where <parameter>password</parameter> is your
                password.</para>
        </step>
    </procedure>
    <para>Alternatively, you can create the
            <filename>openrc.sh</filename> file from scratch.</para>
    <procedure>
        <step>
            <para>Create the <filename>openrc.sh</filename> file
                and add the authentication information:</para>
            <programlisting language="bash">export OS_USERNAME=<replaceable>USERNAME</replaceable>
export OS_PASSWORD=<replaceable>PASSWORD</replaceable>
export OS_TENANT_NAME=<replaceable>PROJECT_NAME</replaceable>
export OS_AUTH_URL=<replaceable>https://IDENTITY_HOST:PORT/v2.0</replaceable>
# The following lines can be omitted
export OS_TENANT_ID=<replaceable>9d792532ffce494583138c495801d164</replaceable>
export OS_REGION_NAME=<replaceable>RegionOne</replaceable></programlisting>
        </step>
        <step>
            <para>On any shell from where you want to run OpenStack
                commands, source the <filename>openrc.sh</filename>
                file for the respective project.</para>
            <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>source openrc.sh</userinput></screen>
        </step>
    </procedure>
    <note>
        <para>You are not prompted for the password with this method.
            The password lives in clear text format in the
                <filename>openrc.sh</filename> file. Restrict the
            permissions on this file to avoid security problems. You
            can also remove the <literal>OS_PASSWORD</literal>
            variable from the file, and use the
                <parameter>--password</parameter> parameter with
            OpenStack client commands.</para>
