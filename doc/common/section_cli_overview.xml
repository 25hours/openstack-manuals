    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>You can use the OpenStack command-line clients to run simple
        commands that make API calls. You can run these commands from
        the command line or in scripts to automate tasks. As long as
        you provide OpenStack credentials, you can run these commands
        on any machine.</para>
    <para>Internally, each client command runs cURL commands that
        embed API requests. The OpenStack APIs are RESTful APIs that
        use the HTTP protocol, including methods, URIs, media types,
        and response codes.</para>
    <para>These open-source Python clients run on Linux or Mac OS X
        systems and are easy to learn and use. Each OpenStack service
        has its own command-line client. On some client commands, you
        can specify a <parameter
            xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
            xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"
            xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
            xmlns:db="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">debug</parameter>
        parameter to show the underlying API request for the command.
        This is a good way to become familiar with the OpenStack API
        calls.</para>
    <para>The following table lists the command-line client for each
        OpenStack service, together with its
        package name and description.</para>
