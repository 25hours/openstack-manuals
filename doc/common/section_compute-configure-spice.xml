  <title>SPICE console</title>
  <para>OpenStack Compute supports VNC consoles to guests. The VNC
    protocol is fairly limited, lacking support for multiple monitors,
    bi-directional audio, reliable cut-and-paste, video streaming and
    more. SPICE is a new protocol that aims to address the limitations
    in VNC and provide good remote desktop support.</para>
  <para>SPICE support in OpenStack Compute shares a similar
    architecture to the VNC implementation. The OpenStack dashboard
    uses a SPICE-HTML5 widget in its console tab that communicates to
    the <systemitem class="service">nova-spicehtml5proxy</systemitem>
    service by using SPICE-over-websockets. The <systemitem
      class="service">nova-spicehtml5proxy</systemitem> service
    communicates directly with the hypervisor process by using SPICE.<note>
      <para>If you do not configure SPICE correctly, Compute falls
        back on VNC.</para>
    </note></para>
  <para>The following table shows the options to configure SPICE as
    the console for OpenStack Compute:</para>
