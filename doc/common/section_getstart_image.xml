      <title>Image Service Overview</title>
      <para>The Image Service includes the following
        components:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><systemitem class="service">glance-api</systemitem>.
            Accepts Image API calls for image discovery, retrieval,
            and storage.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><systemitem class="service"
              >glance-registry</systemitem>. Stores, processes, and
            retrieves metadata about images. Metadata includes size,
            type, and so on.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Database. Stores image metadata. You can choose your
            database depending on your preference. Most deployments
            use MySQL or SQlite.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Storage repository for image files. In <xref
              linkend="os-logical-arch"/>, the Object Storage Service
            is the image repository. However, you can configure a
            different repository. The Image Service supports normal
            file systems, RADOS block devices, Amazon S3, and HTTP.
            Some of these choices are limited to read-only
            usage.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>A number of periodic processes run on the Image Service to
        support caching. Replication services ensures consistency and
        availability through the cluster. Other periodic processes
        include auditors, updaters, and reapers.</para>
      <para>As shown in <xref linkend="conceptual-architecture"/>, the Image
        Service is central to the overall IaaS picture. It accepts API
        requests for images or image metadata from end users or
        Compute components and can store its disk files in the Object
        Storage Service.</para>
