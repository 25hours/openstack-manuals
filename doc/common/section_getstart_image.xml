      <title>Image Service overview</title>
      <para>The Image Service includes the following
        components:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><systemitem class="service">glance-api</systemitem>.
            Accepts Image API calls for image discovery, retrieval,
            and storage.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><systemitem class="service"
          >glance-registry</systemitem>. Stores, processes, and
        retrieves metadata about images. Metadata includes items such
        as size and type.</para>
          <note><title>Security note</title>
          <para>The registry is a private internal service meant only for use
          by the Image Service itself. Do not expose it to users.</para></note>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Database. Stores image metadata. You can choose your
            database depending on your preference. Most deployments
            use MySQL or SQlite.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Storage repository for image files. The Image Service
          supports a variety of repositories including normal file systems,
          Object Storage, RADOS block devices, HTTP, and Amazon S3. Some
          types of repositories support only read-only usage.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>A number of periodic processes run on the Image Service to
        support caching. Replication services ensures consistency and
        availability through the cluster. Other periodic processes
        include auditors, updaters, and reapers.</para>
      <para>As shown in <xref linkend="conceptual-architecture"/>, the Image
        Service is central to the overall IaaS picture. It accepts API
        requests for images or image metadata from end users or
        Compute components and can store its disk files in the Object
        Storage Service.</para>
