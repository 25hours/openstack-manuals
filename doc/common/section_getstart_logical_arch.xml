  <title>Logical architecture</title>
  <para>To design, deploy, and configure OpenStack, administrators must understand the logical architecture.</para>

  <para>As shown in <xref linkend="concept_arch"/>, OpenStack consists of
  several
  independent parts, named the OpenStack services.
  All services authenticate
  through a common Identity service. Individual services interact
  with each other through public APIs, except where privileged
  administrator commands are necessary.</para>

  <para>Internally, OpenStack services are composed of several processes.
  All services have at least one
  API process, which listens for API requests, preprocesses them and
  passes them on to other parts of the service. With the exception of
  the Identity service, the actual work is done by distinct processes.</para>

  <para>For communication between the processes of one service, an AMQP <glossterm>message
  broker</glossterm> is used. The service's state is stored in a database.
  When deploying and configuring your OpenStack cloud, you can choose among
  several message broker and database solutions, such as
  RabbitMQ, Qpid, MySQL, MariaDB, and SQLite.</para>

  <para>Users can access OpenStack via the web-based user interface implemented
  by the <link linkend="ch_install-dashboard">dashboard service</link>,
  via <link xlink:href="http://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/content">command-line clients</link>
  and by issuing API requests through tools like
  browser plug-ins or <command>curl</command>. For applications,
  <link xlink:href="http://developer.openstack.org/#sdk">several SDKs</link>
  are available. Ultimately, all these access methods issue REST API
  calls to the various OpenStack services.</para>

  <para>The following diagram shows the most common, but not the only
    possible, architecture for an OpenStack cloud:</para>
