    <title>Using External Authentication with OpenStack Identity</title>
   <para>When Keystone is executed in <literal>apache-httpd</literal>
    it is possible to use external authentication methods different
    from the authentication provided by the identity store backend.
    For example, this makes possible to use a SQL identity backend
    together with X.509 authentication, Kerberos, etc. instead of using
    the username/password combination.</para>

    <title>Using HTTPD authentication</title>
    <para>Webservers like Apache HTTP support many methods of
     authentication. Keystone can profit from this feature and let the
     authentication be done in the webserver, that will pass down the
     authenticated user to Keystone using the <literal>REMOTE_USER</literal>
     environment variable. This user must exist in advance in the identity
     backend so as to get a token from the controller. To use this method,
     OpenStack Identity should be running on <literal>apache-httpd</literal>.

    <title>Using X.509</title>
    <para>The following snippet for the Apache conf will authenticate
    the user based on a valid X.509 certificate from a known CA:

        SSLCertificateFile    /etc/ssl/certs/ssl.cert
