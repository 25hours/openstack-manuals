<title>Prepare for AMI Type Images</title>
    <para>In order to support AMI type images within your OpenStack
    installation, a directory <literal>/boot/guest</literal> needs to be
    created inside Dom0. The OpenStack VM will put the kernel and ramdisk
    extracted from the AKI and ARI images to this location.</para>

    <para>This directory's content will be maintained by OpenStack, and its
    size should not increase during normal operation. However, in case of power
    failures or accidental shutdowns, some files might be left over. In order
    to prevent these files from filling up Dom0's disk, it is recommended to set up
    this directory as a symlink pointing to a subdirectory of the local SR.
    </para>

    <para>Execute the following commands in Dom0 to achieve the above mentioned
    setup:
<screen><prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>LOCAL_SR=$(xe sr-list name-label="Local storage" --minimal)</userinput>
<prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>LOCALPATH="/var/run/sr-mount/$LOCAL_SR/os-guest-kernels"</userinput>
<prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>mkdir -p "$LOCALPATH"</userinput>
<prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>ln -s "$LOCALPATH" /boot/guest</userinput>
</screen>
    </para>
