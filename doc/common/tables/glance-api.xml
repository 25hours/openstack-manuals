        <td>(StrOpt) Name of eventlet hub to use. Traditionally, we have only supported 'poll', however 'selects' may be appropriate for some platforms. See http://eventlet.net/doc/hubs.html for more details.</td>

        <td>image_size_cap = 1099511627776</td>

        <td>owner_is_tenant = True</td>

        <td>send_identity_headers = False</td>
        <td>(BoolOpt) Whether to pass through headers containing user and tenant information when making requests to the registry. This allows the registry to use the context middleware without keystonemiddleware's auth_token middleware, removing calls to the keystone auth service. It is recommended that when using this option, secure communication between glance api and glance registry is ensured by means other than auth_token middleware.</td>

        <td>show_multiple_locations = False</td>
        <td>(BoolOpt) Whether to include the backend image locations in image properties. Revealing storage location can be a security risk, so use this setting with caution!  The overrides show_image_direct_url.</td>
