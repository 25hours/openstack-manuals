        <td><option>clean_nodes</option> = <replaceable>True</replaceable></td>
        <td>(BoolOpt) Cleaning is a configurable set of steps, such as erasing disk drives, that are performed on the node to ensure it is in a baseline state and ready to be deployed to. This is done after instance deletion, and during the transition from a "managed" to "available" state. When enabled, the particular steps performed to clean a node depend on which driver that node is managed by; see the individual driver's documentation for details. NOTE: The introduction of the cleaning operation causes instance deletion to take significantly longer. In an environment where all tenants are trusted (eg, because there is only one tenant), this option could be safely disabled.</td>
