        <td>admin_endpoint = None</td>
        <td>(StrOpt) The base admin endpoint URL for Keystone that is advertised to clients (NOTE: this does NOT affect how Keystone listens for connections). Defaults to the base host URL of the request. E.g. a request to http://server:35357/v2.0/users will default to http://server:35357. You should only need to set this value if the base URL contains a path (e.g. /prefix/v2.0) or the endpoint should be found on a different server.</td>

        <td>(StrOpt) A "shared secret" that can be used to bootstrap Keystone. This "token" does not represent a user, and carries no explicit authorization. To disable in production (highly recommended), remove AdminTokenAuthMiddleware from your paste application pipelines (for example, in keystone-paste.ini).</td>

        <td>(BoolOpt) Set this to false if you want to enable the ability for user, group and project entities to be moved between domains by updating their domain_id. Allowing such movement is not recommended if the scope of a domain admin is being restricted by use of an appropriate policy file (see policy.v3cloudsample as an example).</td>

      <tr>
        <td>list_limit = None</td>
        <td>(IntOpt) The maximum number of entities that will be returned in a collection, with no limit set by default. This global limit may be then overridden for a specific driver, by specifying a list_limit in the appropriate section (e.g. [assignment]).</td>

        <td>(StrOpt) During a SQL upgrade member_role_id will be used to create a new role that will replace records in the assignment table with explicit role grants. After migration, the member_role_id will be used in the API add_user_to_project.</td>

        <td>strict_password_check = False</td>
        <td>(BoolOpt) If set to true, strict password length checking is performed for password manipulation. If a password exceeds the maximum length, the operation will fail with an HTTP 403 Forbidden error. If set to false, passwords are automatically truncated to the maximum length.</td>
