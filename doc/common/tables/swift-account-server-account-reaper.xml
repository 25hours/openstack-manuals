The value is in seconds, 2592000  =  30 days, for example. bind to giving up worker can process simultaneously (it will actually accept(2) N + 1). Setting this to one (1) will only handle one request at a time, without accepting another request concurrently. By increasing the number of workers to a much higher value, one can reduce the impact of slow file system operations in one request from negatively impacting other requests.</td>
