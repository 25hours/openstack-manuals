    <para>The SolidFire Cluster is a high performance all SSD iSCSI storage device,
        providing massive scale out capability and extreme fault tolerance.  A key
        feature of the SolidFire cluster is the ability to set and modify during
        operation specific QoS levels on a volume per volume basis.  The SolidFire
        cluster offers all of these things along with de-duplication, compression and an
        architecture that takes full advantage of SSD's.</para>
    <para>To configure and use a SolidFire cluster with Cinder modify your
    <filename>cinder.conf</filename> file as shown below:</para>
    <programlisting language="ini">
    volume_driver=cinder.volume.drivers.solidfire.SolidFire
    san_ip=172.17.1.182         # the address of your MVIP
    san_login=sfadmin           # your cluster admin login
    san_password=sfpassword     # your cluster admin password
