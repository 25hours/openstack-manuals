    <para>The SolidFire Cluster is a high performance all SSD iSCSI
        storage device that provides massive scale out capability and
        extreme fault tolerance. A key feature of the SolidFire
        cluster is the ability to set and modify during operation
        specific QoS levels on a volume for volume basis. The
        SolidFire cluster offers this along with de-duplication,
        compression, and an architecture that takes full advantage of
        SSDs.</para>
    <para>To configure the use of a SolidFire cluster with Block
        Storage, modify your <filename>cinder.conf</filename> file as
        follows:</para>
    <programlisting language="ini">volume_driver = cinder.volume.drivers.solidfire.SolidFireDriver
san_ip = 172.17.1.182         # the address of your MVIP
san_login = sfadmin           # your cluster admin login
san_password = sfpassword     # your cluster admin password
sf_account_prefix = ''        # prefix for tenant account creation on solidfire cluster</programlisting>
    <warning>
        <para>Older versions of the  SolidFire driver (prior to Icehouse)
              created a unique account prefixed with
                <literal>$cinder-volume-service-hostname-$tenant-id</literal>
            on the SolidFire cluster for each tenant. Unfortunately, this
            account formation resulted in issues for High Availability
            (HA) installations and installations where the <systemitem
                class="service">cinder-volume</systemitem> service can
            move to a new node. The current default implementation does
            not experience this issue as no prefix is used.  For installations
            created on a prior release, the OLD default behavior can be
            configured by using the keyword "hostname" in sf_account_prefix.
