    <title>StorPool driver</title>
    <para>StorPool is distributed data storage software running on standard x86
        servers. StorPool aggregates the performance and capacity of all drives
        into a shared pool of storage distributed among the servers. Within
        this storage pool the user creates thin-provisioned volumes that are
        exposed to the clients as block devices. StorPool consists of two parts
        wrapped in one package - a server and a client. The StorPool server
        allows a hypervisor to act as a storage node, while the StorPool client
        allows a hypervisor node to access the storage pool and act as a compute
        node. In OpenStack terms the StorPool solution allows each hypervisor
        node to be both a storage and a compute node simultaneously. More

    <note>
        <para>To make full use of StorPool's native network communication protocol,
        the Nova compute nodes will need to use the StorPool libvirt volume
        attachment driver, nova.virt.libvirt.storpool.LibvirtStorPoolVolumeDriver.</para>

    <para>To use Block Storage with StorPool, first set the
            <literal>volume_driver</literal> in
            <filename>cinder.conf</filename>:</para>
    <programlisting>volume_driver=cinder.volume.drivers.storpool.StorPoolDriver</programlisting>
    <para>The following table contains the configuration options
    supported by the StorPool driver.</para>
