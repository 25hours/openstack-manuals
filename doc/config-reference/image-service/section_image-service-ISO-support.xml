    <title>Support for ISO images</title>
    <para>You can load ISO images into the Image service. You can

        <step>
            <para>In the Image service, run the following
                command:</para>
            <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>glance image-create --name "ubuntu-14.04.2-server-amd64.iso" \

            <para>In this command, <literal>ubuntu.iso</literal> is

                <replaceable>ubuntu-14.04.2-server-amd64.iso</replaceable>
                is the name of the source ISO image.</para>

            <para>Optionally, to confirm the upload in Image Service (glance), run this command:</para>            <para>Run this command:</para>

        <title>To boot an instance from an ISO image</title>
            <para>OpenStack supports booting instances using ISO images,
                but in order to make the instances created using ISO images
                functional, follow a few more steps:</para>
        <step>
            <para>Boot instance with ISO image using the following command:</para>
            <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>nova boot \
    --image ubuntu-14.04.2-server-amd64.iso \
    --block-device source=blank,dest=volume,size=10,shutdown=preserve \
    --nic net-id=<replaceable>NETWORK_UUID</replaceable>
    --flavor 3 <replaceable>INSTANCE_NAME</replaceable></userinput></screen>
            <para>In this command, <filename>ubuntu-14.04.2-server-amd64.iso</filename> is
                the ISO image, and <replaceable>INSTANCE_NAME</replaceable> is
                the name of the new instance.
                <replaceable>NETWORK_UUID</replaceable> is a valid network
                id in your system</para>
            <para>You need Block Storage service and the parameter
            <literal>shutdown=preserve</literal> is also mandatory, thus
            the volume will be preserved after the shutdown of the instance.</para>
        </step>
        <step>
            <para>After the instance  is successfully launched,
                connect to the instance using remote console and follow the
                instructions to install the system as using ISO images on
                regular computers. When the installation is finished and
                system rebooted, the instance asks you again to you to
                install the operating system, which means your instance
                is not usable. If you have problems with image creating
                please check the <link xlink:href="http://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/content/ch_creating_images_manually.html">
                Virtual Machine Image Guide</link> for reference.</para>
        </step>
    </procedure>
    <procedure>
        <title>To make the instances booted from ISO image functional</title>
            <para>Now you have to do the following actions to make your
                instances created using ISO actually functional:</para>
        <step>
            <para>Delete the instance you just created:</para>
            <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>nova delete <replaceable>INSTANCE_NAME</replaceable></userinput></screen>
        </step>
        <step>
            <para>After you delete an instance, the system you just
                installed using your ISO image remains because the parameter
                <literal>shutdown=preserve</literal>
                was set, run the following command:</para>
            <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>cinder list</userinput></screen>
            <para>You get a list with all the volumes
                in your system. In this list, you can find the volume
                that is attached to your ISO created instance, with the
                <literal>false</literal> bootable property.</para>
        </step>
        <step>
            <para>Upload the volume to glance:</para>
            <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>cinder upload-to-image <replaceable>VOLUME_UUID</replaceable> <replaceable>IMAGE_NAME</replaceable></userinput></screen>
            <para>The <replaceable>VOLUME_UUID</replaceable> is the uuid
                of the volume that is attached to your ISO created instance,
                and the <replaceable>IMAGE_NAME</replaceable> is the
                name that you give to your new image.</para>
        </step>
        <step>
            <para>After the image is successfully uploaded, you
                can now use the new image to boot instances, the
                instance launched using this image will contain the
                system you just installed using the ISO image.</para>
        </step>
