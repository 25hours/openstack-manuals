  <title>EMC VNX driver</title>
  <para>
    The EMC Shared File Systems service driver framework (EMCShareDriver)
    utilizes the EMC storage products to provide the shared file systems
    to OpenStack. The EMC driver is a plug-in based driver which is designed
    to use different plug-ins to manage different EMC storage products.
  </para>
  <para>
    The VNX plug-in is the plug-in which manages the VNX to provide shared
    filesystems. The EMC driver framework with the VNX plug-in is referred to as
    the VNX driver in this document.
  </para>
  <para>
    This driver performs the operations on VNX by XMLAPI and the file
    command line. Each back end manages one Data Mover of VNX. Multiple
    Shared File Systems service back ends need to be configured to manage
    multiple Data Movers.

      VNX driver only supports CIFS share creation with share network
      which has an Active Directory security-service associated.
    </para>
    <para>
      Creating CIFS share requires that the time on the Data Mover is in
      sync with the Active Directory domain so that the CIFS server can
      join the domain. Otherwise, the domain join will fail when
      creating share with this security service. There is a limitation
      that the time of the domains used by security-services even for
      different tenants and different share networks should be in sync.
      Time difference should be less than 10 minutes.
    </para>
    <para>
      It is recommended to set the NTP server to the same public NTP

      Before creating CIFS share using VNX driver, you must select a

          On VNX the snapshot is stored in the SavVols. VNX system
          allows the space used by SavVol to be created and extended
          until the sum of the space consumed by all SavVols on the
          system exceeds the default 20% of the total space available on
          the system. If the 20% threshold value is reached, an alert
          will be generated on VNX. Continuing to create snapshot will
          cause the old snapshot to be inactivated (and the snapshot
          data to be abandoned). The limit percentage value can be
          changed manually by storage administrator based on the storage
          needs. Administrator is recommended to configure the
          notification on the SavVol usage. Refer to Using VNX SnapSure

          VNX has limitations on the overall numbers of Virtual Data
          Movers, filesystems, shares, checkpoints, etc. Virtual
          Data Mover(VDM) is created by the VNX driver on the VNX to
          serve as the Shared File Systems service share server.
          Similarly, filesystem is
          created, mounted, and exported from the VDM over CIFS or NFS
          protocol to serve as the Shared File Systems service share.
          The VNX checkpoint serves as the Shared File Systems service
          share snapshot. Refer to the
