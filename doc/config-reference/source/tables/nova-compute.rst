.. list-table:: Description of compute configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description

   * - ``consecutive_build_service_disable_threshold`` = ``10``

     - (Integer) Number of consecutive failed builds that result in disabling a compute service.

       This option will cause nova-compute to set itself to a disabled state if a certain number of consecutive build failures occur. This will prevent the scheduler from continuing to send builds to a compute node that is consistently failing. Note that all failures qualify and count towards this score, including reschedules that may have been due to racy scheduler behavior. Since the failures must be consecutive, it is unlikely that occasional expected reschedules will actually disable a compute node.

       Possible values:

       * Any positive integer representing a build failure count.

       * Zero to never auto-disable.
