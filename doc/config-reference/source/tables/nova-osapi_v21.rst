.. list-table:: Description of osapi_v21 configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description

   * - ``project_id_regex`` = ``None``

     - (String) This option is a string representing a regular expression (regex) that matches the project_id as contained in URLs. If not set, it will match normal UUIDs created by keystone.

       Possible values:

       * A string representing any legal regular expression

       - **Deprecated**

         Recent versions of nova constrain project IDs to hexadecimal characters and dashes. If your installation uses IDs outside of this range, you should use this option to provide your own regex and give you time to migrate offending projects to valid IDs before the next release.
