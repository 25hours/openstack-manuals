File naming conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To indicate the hierarchical type of files for filenames:

* Follow a page-based, topical approach to file naming and do not apply
  any special prefixes.
* Use hyphens as space delimiters.

For example, ``technical-considerations-multi-site.rst``.

Directory structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For better organization, use subdirectories to organize the files
by a particular grouping such as project or topic.

Common practices include:

* Figure subdirectory includes images (both PNG and SVG source files).
* Sample subdirectory contains samples of source code and configuration files.
* Chapter subdirectory stores all sections included in one chapter with the
  parent file located in the top-level directory.
