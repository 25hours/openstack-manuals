Landing pages
=============

There are now central landing pages for the various project guides
like one central place for the admin guide at
https://docs.openstack.org/pike/admin/index.html .

To add your project content to these guides, change the file
`www/project-data/latest.yaml
<http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/openstack-manuals/tree/www/project-data/latest.yaml>`_
in the openstack-manuals repository.

See :ref:`template-generator` for details.
