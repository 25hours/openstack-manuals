OpenStack service and project names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use uppercase when you refer to a service name. For example, use
*Compute service*, *Image service*, or *Identity service* instead
of *nova*, *glance*, or *keystone*.

Use lowercase when you refer to:

* project names
* project team names
* command-line interface (CLI)

The official source for services and project names is in the OpenStack
governance repository in the
`projects.yaml <http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/governance/tree/reference/projects.yaml>`_
file.
