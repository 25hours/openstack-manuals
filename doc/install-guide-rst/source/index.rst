OpenStack Installation Guide
============================

Abstract
~~~~~~~~

The OpenStack system consists of several key projects that you install
separately. These projects work together depending on your cloud
needs. These projects include Compute, Identity Service, Networking,
Image Service, Block Storage, Object Storage, Telemetry,
Orchestration, and Database. You can install any of these projects
separately and configure them stand-alone or as connected entities.

This guide documents the OpenStack Liberty release.

.. warning:: This guide is a work-in-progress and changing rapidly
   while we continue to test and enhance the guidance. Please note
   where there are open "to do" items and help where you are able.
