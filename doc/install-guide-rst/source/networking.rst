Add a networking component
==========================

This chapter explains how to install and configure either OpenStack
Networking (neutron), or the legacy ``nova-network`` component. The
``nova-network`` service enables you to deploy one network type per
instance and is suitable for basic network functionality. OpenStack
Networking enables you to deploy multiple network types per instance
and includes :term:`plug-in` s for a variety of products that support
:term:`virtual networking`.

For more information, see the
`Networking <http://docs.openstack.org/admin-guide-cloud/content/ch_networking.html>`__
chapter of the OpenStack Cloud Administrator Guide.
