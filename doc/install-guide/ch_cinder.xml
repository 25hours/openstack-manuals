  <title>Add the Block Storage Service</title>
  <para>The OpenStack Block Storage Service works though the
    interaction of a series of daemon processes named <systemitem
      role="process">cinder-*</systemitem> that reside persistently on
    the host machine or machines. You can run the binaries from a
    single node or across multiple nodes. You can also run them on the
    same node as other OpenStack services. The following sections
    introduce Block Storage Service components and concepts and show
    you how to configure and install the Block Storage Service.</para>
