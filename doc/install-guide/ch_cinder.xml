  <title>Adding Block Storage</title>
       <para>The OpenStack Block Storage service works though the interaction of a series of daemon
              processes named cinder-* that reside persistently on the host machine or machines. The
              binaries can all be run from a single node, or spread across multiple nodes. They can
              also be run on the same node as other OpenStack services. The following sections
              explain the Block Storage components as well as how to configure and install Block
              Storage.</para>
