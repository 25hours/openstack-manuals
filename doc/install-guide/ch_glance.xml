    <title>Configure the Image Service</title>
    <para>The OpenStack Image Service enables users to discover,
        register, and retrieve virtual machine images. Also known as
        the glance project, the Image Service offers a
        <glossterm baseform="RESTful">REST</glossterm> API that
        enables you to query virtual machine image metadata and
        retrieve an actual image. Virtual machine images made
        available through the Image Service can be stored in a variety
        of locations from simple file systems to object-storage
        systems like OpenStack Object Storage.</para>
    <important>
      <para>
        For simplicity this guide configures the Image Service to use the
        <literal>file</literal> backend. This means that images uploaded to
        the Image Service will be stored in a directory on the same system that
        hosts the service. By default this directory is
        <filename>/var/lib/glance/images/</filename>.
      </para>
      <para>
        Ensure that the system has sufficient space available under this
        directory to store virtual machine images and snapshots before
        proceeding. At an absolute minimum several gigabytes of space should
        be available for use by the Image Service in a proof of concept
        deployment.
