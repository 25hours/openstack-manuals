  <title>Configure the Image Service</title>
  <para>The OpenStack Image Service enables users to discover,
    register, and retrieve virtual machine images. Also known as the
    glance project, the Image Service offers a <glossterm
      baseform="RESTful">REST</glossterm> API that enables you to
    query virtual machine image metadata and retrieve an actual image.
    You can store virtual machine images made available through the
    Image Service in a variety of locations from simple file systems
    to object-storage systems like OpenStack Object Storage.</para>
  <important>
    <para>For simplicity, this guide configures the Image Service to
      use the <literal>file</literal> back end. This means that images
      uploaded to the Image Service are stored in a directory on the
      same system that hosts the service. By default, this directory
      is <filename>/var/lib/glance/images/</filename>.</para>
    <para>Before you proceed, ensure that the system has sufficient
      space available in this directory to store virtual machine
      images and snapshots. At an absolute minimum, several gigabytes
      of space should be available for use by the Image Service in a
      proof of concept deployment. To see requirements for other back
      ends, see <link
