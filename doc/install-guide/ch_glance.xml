    <title>Configuring the Image Service</title>
    <para>The OpenStack Image service provides users the ability to discover,
        register, and retrieve virtual machine images. Also known as
        the glance project, the Image service offers a REST API that
        allows querying of virtual machine image metadata as well as
        retrieval of the actual image. Virtual machine images made
        available through the Image service can be stored in a variety
        of locations from simple filesystems to object-storage systems
        like the OpenStack Object Storage service.</para>
