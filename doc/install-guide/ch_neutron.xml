    <title>Considerations for OpenStack Networking</title>
  <para>There are many different drivers for OpenStack Networking,
  that range from software bridges to full control of certain
  switching hardware. This guide focuses on the simplest: the
  Linux Bridge. However, the theories presented here should be
  mostly applicable to other mechanisms.</para>
  <!-- Note that Linux Bridge is deprecated and will be replaced with ML2
       in Icehouse. Still, Linux Bridge might be the best option for
       this guide for Havana. -->
  <!-- description of architecture, network node etc -->
  <!-- description of Linux Bridge Driver, where agents run etc -->
  <!-- install of network node -->
  <!-- configuration of compute node -->
  <warning><para>If you have followed the previous section on setting
  up networking for your compute node using nova-network, this will
  override those settings.</para></warning>

  <!-- This is just a start at incorporating the many use cases from
       the origina network admin guide. -->
