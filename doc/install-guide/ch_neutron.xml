    <title>Installing OpenStack Networking Service</title>

    <warning>
      <para>This chapter is a bit more adventurous than we would
      like. We are working on cleanup and improvements to it. Like for
      the rest of the Installation Guide, feedback via bug reports and
      patches to improve it are welcome.

        <title>Considerations for OpenStack Networking</title>
        <para>Drivers for OpenStack Networking range from software
            bridges to full control of certain switching hardware.
            This guide focuses on the Open vSwitch driver. However,
            the theories presented here should be mostly applicable to
            other mechanisms, and the <link

                    Reference</citetitle></link> offers additional
            information.</para>

            prepare for installation, see <xref

            <para>If you followed the previous chapter to set up
                networking for your compute node using <systemitem
                    role="service">nova-network</systemitem>, this
                configuration overrides those settings.</para>
