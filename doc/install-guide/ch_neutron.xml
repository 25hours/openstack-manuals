  <title>Considerations for OpenStack Networking</title>
  <para>There are many different drivers for OpenStack Networking,
      that range from software bridges to full control of certain
      switching hardware. This guide focuses on Open vSwitch. However,
      the theories presented here should be mostly applicable to other
      mechanisms, and the <citetitle>OpenStack Configuration
        Reference</citetitle> offers additional information.</para>
    <para>Please see <link

        >OpenStack
        Packages</link> for specific OpenStack installation
      instructions to prepare for installation.</para>
            <warning><para>If you have followed the previous section on
                setting up networking for your compute node using
                nova-network, this configuration will override those
                settings.</para></warning>
