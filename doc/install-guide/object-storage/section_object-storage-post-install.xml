                <title>Add a proxy server</title>
                <para>For reliability, you add proxy servers. You can
                        set up an additional proxy node the same way
                        that you set up the first proxy node but with
                        additional configuration steps.</para>
                <para>After you have more than two proxies, you must
                        load balance them; your storage endpoint (what
                        clients use to connect to your storage) also
                        changes. You can select from different
                        strategies for load balancing. For example,
                        you could use round-robin DNS, or a software
                        or hardware load balancer (like pound) in
                        front of the two proxies, and point your
                        storage URL to the load balancer.</para>
                <para>Configure an initial proxy node. Then, complete
                        these steps to add proxy servers.</para>

                                <para>Update the list of memcache

                                   you run multiple memcache servers,
                                   use this pattern for the multiple
                                   IP:port listings in each proxy

                                   Also, ensure that the ring
                                   information gets to all storage
                                   nodes.</para>
