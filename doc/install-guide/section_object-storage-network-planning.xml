    <para>For both conserving network resources and ensuring that
        network administrators understand the needs for networks and
        public IP addresses for providing access to the APIs and
        storage network as necessary, this section offers
        recommendations and required minimum sizes. Throughput of at
        least 1000 Mbps is suggested.</para>
  <para>This document refers to three networks. One is a Public Network for
        connecting to the Proxy server. The second is a Storage Network that is not
        accessible from outside the cluster, to which all of the nodes are
        connected. Third is a Replication Network that is also isolated from
        outside networks and dedicated to replication traffic between Storage nodes.</para>
  <para>Public and Storage Networks are mandatory. Replication Network is optional and
        must be configured in the Ring.</para>
  <para>By default, all of the OpenStack Object Storage services, as well as the
        rsync daemon on the Storage nodes are configured to listen on their
        STORAGE_LOCAL_NET IP addresses.</para>
    <para>If Replication Network configured in the Ring, then Account, Container
          and Object servers listen on both STORAGE_LOCAL_NET and STORAGE_REPLICATION_NET
          IP addresses. Rsync daemon will only listen on STORAGE_REPLICATION_NET IP
          address in this case.</para>
    <para>Public Network (Publicly routable IP range): This network is utilized
        for providing Public IP accessibility to the API endpoints within the cloud
        infrastructure.</para>
        <para>Minimum size: 8 IPs (CIDR /29)</para>
    <para>Storage Network (RFC1918 IP Range, not publicly routable):
        This network is utilized for all inter-server communications
        within the Object Storage infrastructure.</para>
    <para>Recommended size: 255 IPs (CIDR /24)</para>
    <para>Replication Network (RFC1918 IP Range, not publicly routable):
        This network is utilized for replication-related communications
        between storage servers within the Object Storage infrastructure.</para>
    <para>Recommended size: 255 IPs (CIDR /24)</para>
