==========================
Install OpenStack services
==========================

The installation of individual OpenStack services is covered in the
Project Installation Guides that are available at the following
locations:

* `OpenStack Pike Installation Tutorials and Guides
  <https://docs.openstack.org/pike/install/>`_


.. Note that this guide is release independent, so we will add more
   entries to the list above.


At minimal you need to install - in this order - the following
components:

* Identity service (keystone)
* Image service (glance)
* Compute service (nova)
* Networking service (neutron)

We advise to also install afterwards:

* Dashboard (horizon)
* Block Storage service (cinder)
