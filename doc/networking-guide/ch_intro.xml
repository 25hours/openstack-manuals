    <title>Introduction to networking</title>
    <para>
      The OpenStack Networking service provides an API that allows users
      to set up and define network connectivity and addressing in the
      cloud. The project code-name for Networking services is neutron.
      OpenStack Networking handles the creation and management
      of a virtual networking infrastructure, including
      <glossterm baseform="network">networks</glossterm>, switches,
      <glossterm baseform="subnet">subnets</glossterm>, and
      <glossterm baseform="router">routers</glossterm> for devices
      managed by the
      OpenStack Compute service (nova). Advanced services such as
      <glossterm baseform="firewall">firewalls</glossterm> or
      <glossterm baseform="virtual private network (VPN)">virtual
      private networks (VPNs)</glossterm> can also be used.
    </para>
    <para>
      OpenStack Networking consists of the
      <systemitem class="service">neutron-server</systemitem>, a
      database for persistent storage, and any number of plugin
      <firstterm>agents</firstterm>, which provide
      other services such as interfacing with native Linux networking
      mechanisms, external devices, or SDN controllers.
    </para>
    <para>
      OpenStack Networking is entirely standalone and can be deployed
      to a dedicated host. If your deployment uses a controller
      host to run centralized Compute components, you can
      deploy the Networking server to that specific host instead.

        <para>
          OpenStack Networking integrates with various other OpenStack
          components:
