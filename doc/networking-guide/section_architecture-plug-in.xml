      The legacy networking (nova-network) implementation assumed a basic model
      of isolation through Linux VLANs and IP tables. Networking introduces
      support for vendor plug-ins, which offer a custom back-end
      implementation of the Networking API. A plugin can use a variety of
      technologies to implement the logical API requests. Some networking
      plug-ins might use basic Linux VLANs and IP tables, while others might
      use more advanced technologies, such as L2-in-L3 tunneling or
      OpenFlow, to provide similar benefits.

Plug-ins can have different properties for hardware requirements, features, performance, scale, or operator tools. Because Networking supports a large number of plug-ins, the cloud administrator can weigh options to decide on the right networking technology for the deployment.
In the Havana release, OpenStack Networking introduces the Modular Layer 2 (ML2) plug-in that enables the use of multiple concurrent mechanism drivers. This capability aligns with the complex requirements typically found in large heterogeneous environments. It currently works with the existing Open vSwitch, Linux Bridge, and Hyper-v L2 agents. The ML2 framework simplifies the addition of support for new L2 technologies and reduces the effort that is required to add and maintain them compared to earlier large plug-ins.
NOTE
The Open vSwitch and Linux Bridge plug-ins are deprecated in the Havana release and will be removed in the Icehouse release. The features in these plug-ins are now part of the ML2 plug-in in the form of mechanism drivers.
