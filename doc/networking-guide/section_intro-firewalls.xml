    <para>A firewall is a network security system that controls the
    network traffic using a set of rules. For example, a firewall might
    disallow traffic originating from a range of IP addresses or only
    allow traffic on specific ports. Firewalls are often used between
    internal networks, where data is trusted, and external networks
    such as the Internet.</para>

    <para>Many firewalls incorporate Network Address Translation (NAT).
    Network address translation masks the IP addresses of the devices on
    the internal network, so that external devices see only the single
    public IP address of the device hosting the firewall.</para>
