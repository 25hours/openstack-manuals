      A namespace is a container for a set of identifiers. Namespaces provide a level of
      direction to specific identifiers and make it possible to differentiate between
      identifiers with the same exact name. With network namespaces, you can have
      different and separate instances of network interfaces and routing tables that
      operate separate from each other.
