====================================
Using OpenStack Networking with IPv6
====================================

The purpose of this page is to describe how the features and
functionality available in OpenStack (using neutron networking) as of
the Kilo release. It is intended to serve as a guide for how to deploy
IPv6-enabled instances using OpenStack Networking. Where appropriate,
features planned for Liberty or beyond may be described.

The basics
~~~~~~~~~~

OpenStack Networking has supported IPv6 tenant subnets in certain
configurations since Juno, but the Kilo release adds a number of new
features, functionality and bug fixes to make it more robust. The
focus of this page will be:

* How to enable dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6 enabled) instances.
* How those instances receive an IPv6 address.
* How those instances communicate across a router to other subnets or
  the internet.
* How those instances interact with other OpenStack services.

To enable a dual-stack network in OpenStack Networking simply requires
creating a subnet with the ``ip_version`` field set to ``6``, then the
IPv6 attributes (``ipv6_ra_mode`` and ``ipv6_address_mode``) set.  The
``ipv6_ra_mode`` and ``ipv6_address_mode`` will be described in detail in
the next section. Finally, the subnets ``cidr`` needs to be provided.

Not in scope
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Things not in the scope of this document include:

* Single stack IPv6 tenant networking
* OpenStack control communication between servers and services over an IPv6
  network.
* Connection to the OpenStack APIs via an IPv6 transport network
* IPv6 multicast
* IPv6 support in conjunction with any out of tree routers, switches, services
  or agents whether in physical or virtual form factors.


Neutron subnets and the IPv6 API attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of Juno, the OpenStack networking service (neutron) provides two
new attributes to the Subnet object, which allows users of the API to
configure IPv6 subnets.

There are two IPv6 attributes:

* ``ipv6_ra_mode``
* ``ipv6_address_mode``

These attributes can be set to the following values:

* ``slaac``
* ``dhcpv6-stateful``
* ``dhcpv6-stateless``

The attributes can also be left unset.


IPv6 addressing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``ipv6_address_mode`` attribute is used to control how addressing is
handled by OpenStack. There are a number of different ways that guest
instances can obtain an IPv6 address, and this attribute exposes these
choices to users of the Networking API.


Router advertisements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``ipv6_ra_mode`` attribute is used to control router
advertisements for a subnet.

The IPv6 Protocol uses Internet Control Message Protocol packets
(ICMPv6) as a way to distribute information about networking. ICMPv6
packets with the type flag set to 134 are called "Router
Advertisement" packets, which broadcasts information about the router
and the route that can be used by guest instances to send network
traffic.

The ``ipv6_ra_mode`` is used to specify if the Networking service should
transmit ICMPv6 packets, for a subnet.

Tenant network considerations
-----------------------------


Dataplane
~~~~~~~~~

Both the Linux bridge and the OVS dataplane modules support forwarding IPv6
packets amongst the guests and router ports. Similar to IPv4, there is no
special configuration or setup required to enable the dataplane to properly
forward packets from the source to the destination using IPv6. Note that these
dataplanes will forward Link-local Address (LLA) packets between hosts on the
same network just fine without any participation or setup by OpenStack
components after the ports are all connected and MAC addresses learned.

Addresses for subnets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are four methods for a subnet to get its ``cidr`` in OpenStack:

#. Direct assignment during subnet creation via command line or Horizon
#. Referencing a subnet pool during subnet creation

In the future, different techniques could be used to allocate subnets
to tenants:

#. Using a PD client to request a prefix for a subnet from a PD server
#. Use of an external IPAM module to allocate the subnet

Address modes for ports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: That an external DHCPv6 server in theory could override the full
          address OpenStack assigns based on the EUI-64 address, but that
          would not be wise as it would not be consistent through the system.

IPv6 supports three different addressing schemes for address configuration and
for providing optional network information.

Stateless Address Auto Configuration (SLAAC)
  Address configuration using Router Advertisement (RA).

DHCPv6-stateless
  Address configuration using RA and optional information
  using DHCPv6.

DHCPv6-stateful
  Address configuration and optional information using DHCPv6.

OpenStack can be setup such that Neutron directly provides RA, DHCP
relay and DHCPv6 address and optional information for their networks
or this can be delegated to external routers and services based on the
drivers that are in use. There are two Neutron subnet attributes -
``ipv6_ra_mode`` and ``ipv6_address_mode`` â€“ that determine how IPv6
addressing and network information is provided to tenant instances:

* ``ipv6_ra_mode``: Determines who sends RA.
* ``ipv6_address_mode``: Determines how instances obtain IPv6 address,
  default gateway, or optional information.

For the above two attributes to be effective, ``enable_dhcp`` must be
set to True in file :file:`neutron.conf`.

Using SLAAC for addressing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using SLAAC, the currently supported combinations for ``ipv6_ra_mode`` and
``ipv6_address_mode`` are as follows.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 10 50

   * - ipv6_ra_mode
     - ipv6_address_mode
     - Result
   * - Not specified.
     - SLAAC
     - Addresses are assigned using EUI-64, and an external router
       will be used for routing.
   * - SLAAC
     - SLAAC
     - Address are assigned using EUI-64, and OpenStack Networking
       provides routing.

Setting ``ipv6_ra_mode`` to ``slaac`` will result in OpenStack Networking
routers being configured to send RA packets, when they are created.
This results in the following values set for the address configuration
flags in the RA messages:

* Auto Configuration Flag = 1 Managed
* Configuration Flag = 0
* Other Configuration Flag = 0 New or existing

Neutron networks that contain a SLAAC enabled IPv6 subnet will result
in all Neutron ports attached to the network receiving IPv6 addresses.
This is because when RA broadcast messages are sent out on a Neutron
network, they are received by all IPv6 capable ports on the network,
and each port will then configure an IPv6 address based on the
information contained in the RA packet. In some cases, an IPv6 SLAAC
address will be added to a port, in addition to other IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
that the port already has been assigned.

DHCPv6
~~~~~~

For DHCPv6-stateless, the currently supported combinations are as
follows:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 10 50

   * - ipv6_ra_mode
     - ipv6_address_mode
     - Result
   * - DHCPv6-stateless
     - DHCPv6-stateless
     - Address and optional information using Neutron router and DHCP
       implementation respectively.
   * - DHCPv6-stateful
     - DHCPv6-stateful
     - Addresses and optional information are assigned using DHCPv6.

Setting DHCPv6-stateless for ``ipv6_ra_mode`` configures the Neutron
router with radvd agent to send RAs. The table below captures the
values set for the address configuration flags in the RA packet in
this scenario. Similarly, setting DHCPv6-stateless for
``ipv6_address_mode`` configures Neutron DHCP implementation to provide
the additional network information.

* Auto Configuration Flag = 1
* Managed Configuration Flag = 0
* Other Configuration Flag = 1

.. todo:: We probably want to have placeholders for some of the Liberty work
          like prefix delegation, etc.

Router support
--------------

The behavior of the Neutron router for IPv6 is different than IPv4 in
a few ways.

Internal router ports, that act as default gateway ports for a network, will
share a common port for all IPv6 subnets associated with the network. This
implies that there will be an IPv6 internal router interface with multiple
IPv6 addresses from each of the IPv6 subnets associated with the network and a
separate IPv4 internal router interface for the IPv4 subnet. On the other
hand, external router ports are allowed to have a dual-stack configuration
with both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address assigned to them.

Neutron tenant networks that are assigned Global Unicast Address (GUA) prefixes
and addresses donâ€™t require NAT on the Neutron router external gateway port to
access the outside world. As a consequence of the lack of NAT the external
router port doesnâ€™t require a GUA to send and receive to the external networks.
This implies a GUA IPv6 subnet prefix is not necessarily needed for the Neutron
external network. By default, a IPv6 LLA associated with the external gateway
port can be used for routing purposes. To handle this scenario, the
implementation of router-gateway-set API in Neutron has been modified so
that an IPv6 subnet is not required for the external network that is
associated with the Neutron router. The LLA address of the upstream router
can be learned in two ways.

#. In the absence of an upstream RA support, ``ipv6_gateway`` flag can be set
   with the external router gateway LLA in the Neutron L3 agent configuration
   file. This also requires that no subnet is associated with that port.
#. The upstream router can send an RA and the neutron router will
   automatically learn the next-hop LLA, provided again that no subnet is
   assigned and the ``ipv6_gateway`` flag is not set.

Effectively the ``ipv6_gateway`` flag takes precedence over an RA that
is received from the upstream router. If it is desired to use a GUA
next hop that is accomplished by allocating a subnet to the external
router port and assigning the upstream routers GUA address as the
gateway for the subnet.

.. note:: That it should be possible for tenants to communicate with each other
          on an isolated network (a network without a router port) using LLA
          with little to no participation on the part of OpenStack. The authors
          of this section have not proven that to be true for all scenarios.

Neutron's Distributed Router feature and IPv6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IPv6 does work when the Distributed Virtual Router functionality is enabled,
but all ingress/egress traffic is via the centralized router (hence, not
distributed). More work is required to fully enable this functionality.


Advanced services
-----------------

VPNaaS
~~~~~~

VPNaaS supports IPv6, but support in Kilo and prior releases will have
some bugs that may limit how it can be used. More thorough and
complete testing and bug fixing is being done as part of the Liberty
release. IPv6-based VPN as a service is configured similar to the IPv4
configuration. Either or both the ``peer_address`` and the
``peer_cidr`` can specified as an IPv6 address. The choice of
addressing modes and router modes described above should not impact
support.


LBaaS
~~~~~

TODO

FWaaS
~~~~~

FWaaS allows creation of IPv6 based rules.

NAT & Floating IPs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the current time OpenStack Neutron does not provide any facility to support
any flavor of NAT with IPv6. Unlike IPv4 there is no current embedded support
for floating IPs with IPv6. It is assumed that the IPv6 addressing amongst the
tenants are using GUAs with no overlap across the tenants.

Security considerations
-----------------------

.. todo:: Initially this is probably just stating the security group rules
          relative to IPv6 that are applied.   Need some help for these

Configuring interfaces of the guest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenStack currently doesn't support the privacy extensions defined by RFC 4941.
The interface identifier and DUID used must be directly derived from the MAC
as described in RFC 2373. The compute hosts must not be setup to utilize the
privacy extensions when generating their interface identifier.

There is no provisions for an IPv6-based metadata service similar to what is
provided for IPv4. In the case of dual stack Guests though it is always
possible to use the IPv4 metadata service instead.

Unlike IPv4 the MTU of a given network can be conveyed in the RA messages sent
by the router and not in the DHCP messages. In Kilo the MTU sent by RADVD is
always 1500, but in Liberty changes are planned to allow the RA to send the
proper MTU of the network.

OpenStack control & management network considerations
-----------------------------------------------------

As of the Kilo release, considerable effort has gone in to ensuring
the tenant network can handle dual stack IPv6 and IPv4 transport
across the variety of configurations describe above. This same level
of scrutiny has not been apply to running the OpenStack control
network in a dual stack configuration. Similarly, little scrutiny has
gone into ensuring that the OpenStack API endpoints can be accessed
via an IPv6 network. At this time, OpenVswitch (OVS) tunnel types -
STT, VXLAN, GRE, only support IPv4 endpoints, not IPv6, so a full
IPv6-only deployment is not possible with that technology.
