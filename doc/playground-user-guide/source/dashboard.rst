===================
OpenStack dashboard
===================

As a cloud end user, you can use the OpenStack dashboard to provision
your own resources within the limits set by administrators. You can
modify the examples provided in this section to create other types and
sizes of server instances.

.. Files should be in order of current User Guides and then as following:
   Files currently in End User Guide
   Files currently only in Admn User Guide, marked with admin_only

   Since Sphinx does not allow comments below, empty lines are used
   as separators.
