      <title>Case Study : Alice the private cloud builder</title>
      <para>Alice is deploying a private cloud for use by a government department in the US. The cloud must comply with relevant standards such as FedRAMP. The security paperwork requirements for this cloud are very high. It will have no direct access to the internet, its API endpoints, compute instances and other resources will be exposed only to systems within the departments network which is entirely air-gapped from all other networks. The cloud can access other network services on the Organization's Intranet e.g. the authentication and logging services.</para>

      <title>Case Study : Bob the public cloud provider</title>
      <para>Bob is a lead architect for a company deploying a large
      greenfield public cloud. This cloud will provide IaaS for the
      masses, allowing any consumer with a valid credit-card access to
      utility computing and storage but the primary focus is
      enterprise customers. Data privacy concerns are a big priority
      for Bob as they are seen as a major barrier to large-scale
      adoption of the cloud by organizations.</para>
