    <title>Storage</title>
    <para>In the Protection of Tenant Data section we discuss a variety of issues related to storage security. However, due to the time constraints with the book sprint that created the original version of this book, we do not have specific guidance related to configuration of the storage projects (e.g., Swift, Cinder, and Glance).</para>
    <para>We encourage community contributions to help improve this chapter for a future version.</para>
