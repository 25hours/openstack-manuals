    <title>Overview of CLIs</title><para>The CLIs are open-source Python clients used to run commands
        to make API calls. For example, each nova client command runs
        cURL commands that embed API v2 requests. You can run the CLI
        from a desktop machine or remote system. For example, to use
        the Compute API from the command-line, install the nova
        client. A common openstack CLI is in development also.  </para>
    <para>To install a client on a Mac OS X or Linux system, you can
        use easy_install or pip or install the package from your Linux
        distribution. Using pip is recommended because it is easy and
        it ensures that you get the latest version of the nova client
        from the Python Package Index. Also, it lets you update the
        package later on. </para>
    <para>Here are the CLIs for use with OpenStack clouds:<itemizedlist>
