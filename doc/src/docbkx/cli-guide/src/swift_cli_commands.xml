Usage: swift &lt;command> [options] [args]

Commands:
  stat [container] [object]
    Displays information for the account, container, or object depending on the
    args given (if any).
  list [options] [container]
    Lists the containers for the account or the objects for a container. -p or
    --prefix is an option that will only list items beginning with that prefix.
    -d or --delimiter is option (for container listings only) that will roll up
    items with the given delimiter (see Cloud Files general documentation for
    what this means).
  upload [options] container file_or_directory [file_or_directory] [...]
    Uploads to the given container the files and directories specified by the
    remaining args. -c or --changed is an option that will only upload files
    that have changed since the last upload. -S &lt;size> or --segment-size &lt;size>
    and --leave-segments are options as well (see --help for more).
  post [options] [container] [object]
    Updates meta information for the account, container, or object depending on
    the args given. If the container is not found, it will be created
    automatically; but this is not true for accounts and objects. Containers
    also allow the -r (or --read-acl) and -w (or --write-acl) options. The -m
    or --meta option is allowed on all and used to define the user meta data
    items to set in the form Name:Value. This option can be repeated. Example:
    post -m Color:Blue -m Size:Large
  download --all OR download container [options] [object] [object] ...
    Downloads everything in the account (with --all), or everything in a
    container, or a list of objects depending on the args given. For a single
    object download, you may use the -o [--output] &lt;filename> option to
    redirect the output to a specific file or if "-" then just redirect to
    stdout.
  delete [options] --all OR delete container [options] [object] [object] ...
    Deletes everything in the account (with --all), or everything in a
    container, or a list of objects depending on the args given. Segments of
    manifest objects will be deleted as well, unless you specify the
    --leave-segments option.

Example:
  swift -A https://auth.api.rackspacecloud.com/v1.0 -U user -K key stat
