    <para>You can use OpenStack Image Services for discovering,
        registering, and retrieving virtual machine images. The
        service includes a RESTful API that allows users to query VM
        image metadata and retrieve the actual image with HTTP
        requests, or you can use a client class in your Python code to
        accomplish the same tasks. </para>
    <para> VM images made available through OpenStack Image Service
        can be stored in a variety of locations from simple file
        systems to object-storage systems like the OpenStack Object
        Storage project, or even use S3 storage either on its own or
        through an OpenStack Object Storage S3 interface.</para>
    <para>The backend stores that OpenStack Image Service can work
        with are as follows:</para>

        <listitem>
            <para>OpenStack Object Storage - OpenStack Object Storage

            <para>Filesystem - The default backend that OpenStack
                Image Service uses to store virtual machine images is
                the filesystem backend. This simple backend writes
                image files to the local filesystem.</para>

            image you just uploaded.</para>
        
        
        <para>Now you can schedule, launch and connect to the instance, which you do with the "nova"
            command line. The ID of the image will be used with the <literallayout class="monospaced">nova boot</literallayout>command.</para>
        <para>One thing to note here, once you publish the tarball, it has to untar before
            you can launch an image from it. Using the 'nova list' command, and make sure the image
            has it's status as "ACTIVE".</para>
        
        <para><literallayout class="monospaced">nova image-list</literallayout></para>
        
        <para>Depending on the image that you're using, you need a public key to connect to it. Some
            images have built-in accounts already created. Images can be shared by many users, so it
            is dangerous to put passwords into the images. Nova therefore supports injecting ssh
            keys into instances before they are booted. This allows a user to login to the instances
            that he or she creates securely. Generally the first thing that a user does when using
            the system is create a keypair. </para>
        <para>Keypairs provide secure authentication to your instances. As part of the first boot of
            a virtual image, the private key of your keypair is added to root’s authorized_keys
            file. Nova generates a public and private key pair, and sends the private key to the
            user. The public key is stored so that it can be injected into instances. </para>
        <para>Keypairs are created through the api and you use them as a parameter when launching an
            instance. They can be created on the command line using the following command :
            <literallayout class="monospaced">nova keypair-add</literallayout>In order to list all the available options, you would run :<literallayout class="monospaced">nova help </literallayout>
            Example usage:</para>
        
        <literallayout class="monospaced">
nova keypair-add test > test.pem
chmod 600 test.pem
                    </literallayout>
        
        <para>Now, you can run the instances:</para>
        <literallayout class="monospaced">nova boot --image 1 --flavor 1 --key_name test my-first-server</literallayout>
        <para>Here's a description of the parameters used above:</para>

        <para>There are several pre-built images for OpenStack
            available from various sources. You can download such
            images and use them to get familiar with OpenStack. You
            can refer to <link
                xlink:href="http://docs.openstack.org/cactus/openstack-compute/admin/content/starting-images.html"
                >http://docs.openstack.org/cactus/openstack-compute/admin/content/starting-images.html</link>
            for details on using such images.</para>
        <para>For any production deployment, you may like to have the
            ability to bundle custom images, with a custom set of
            applications or configuration. This chapter will guide you
            through the process of creating Linux images of Debian and
            Redhat based distributions from scratch. We have also
            covered an approach to bundling Windows images.</para>
        <para>There are some minor differences in the way you would
            bundle a Linux image, based on the distribution. Ubuntu
            makes it very easy by providing cloud-init package, which
            can be used to take care of the instance configuration at
            the time of launch. cloud-init handles importing ssh keys
            for password-less login, setting hostname etc. The
            instance acquires the instance specific configuration from
            Nova-compute by connecting to a meta data interface
            running on 169.254.169.254.</para>
        <para>While creating the image of a distro that does not have
            cloud-init or an equivalent package, you may need to take
            care of importing the keys etc. by running a set of
            commands at boot time from rc.local.</para>
        <para>The process used for Ubuntu and Fedora is largely the
            same with a few minor differences, which are explained
            below.</para>

        <para>In both cases, the documentation below assumes that you
            have a working KVM installation to use for creating the
            images. We are using the machine called
            &#8216;client1&#8242; as explained in the chapter on
            &#8220;Installation and Configuration&#8221; for this
            purpose.</para>
        <para>The approach explained below will give you disk images
            that represent a disk without any partitions. Nova-compute
            can resize such disks ( including resizing the file
            system) based on the instance type chosen at the time of
            launching the instance. These images cannot have
            &#8216;bootable&#8217; flag and hence it is mandatory to
            have associated kernel and ramdisk images. These kernel
            and ramdisk images need to be used by nova-compute at the
            time of launching the instance.</para>
        <para>However, we have also added a small section towards the
            end of the chapter about creating bootable images with
            multiple partitions that can be be used by nova to launch
            an instance without the need for kernel and ramdisk
            images. The caveat is that while nova-compute can re-size
            such disks at the time of launching the instance, the file
            system size is not altered and hence, for all practical
            purposes, such disks are not re-sizable.</para>

                images will be usable only after the process is
                complete. You can keep checking the status using the
                command &#8216;euca-describe-images&#8217; as

                want the flexibility of using the same disk image with
                different kernel/ramdisk images, you can go for
                bootable disk images. This greatly simplifies the
                process of bundling and registering the images.
                However, the caveats mentioned in the introduction to
                this chapter apply. Please note that the instructions
                below use server.img and you can skip all the

                    <para> Mainly, it wouldn't take more than 5
                        minutes in order to go from a "SAVING" to the
                        "ACTIVE" state. If this takes longer than five
                        minutes, here are several hints: </para>
                    <para>- The feature doesn't work while you have
                        attached a volume (via nova-volume) to the
                        instance. Thus, you should dettach the volume
                        first, create the image, and re-mount the
                        volume.</para>
                    <para>- Make sure the version of qemu you are
                        using is not older than the 0.14 version. That
                        would create "unknown option -s" into
                        nova-compute.log.</para>
                    <para>- Look into nova-api.log and
                        nova-compute.log for extra information.</para>
