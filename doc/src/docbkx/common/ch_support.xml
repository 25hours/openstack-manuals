    <title>Support</title>
    <para>Online resources aid in supporting OpenStack and the community members are willing and able to answer questions and help with bug suspicions. We are constantly improving and adding to the main features of OpenStack, but if you have any problems, do not hesitate to ask. Here are some ideas for supporting OpenStack and troubleshooting your existing installations.</para>

            <title>ask.openstack.org</title>
            <para>During setup or testing, you may have questions
                about how to do something, or end up in a situation
                where you can't seem to get a feature to work
                correctly. The ask.openstack.org site is available for
                questions and answers. When visiting the Ask site at
                    <link xlink:href="http://ask.openstack.org"
                    >http://ask.openstack.org</link>, it is usually
                good to at least scan over recently asked questions to
                see if your question has already been answered. If
                that is not the case, then proceed to adding a new
                question. Be sure you give a clear, concise summary in
                the title and provide as much detail as possible in
                the description. Paste in your command output or stack
                traces, link to screenshots, and so on.</para>

        <simplesect><title>OpenStack mailing lists</title>
        <para>Posting your question or scenario to the OpenStack
                mailing list is a great way to get answers and
                insights. You can learn from and help others who may
                have the same scenario as you. Go to <link
                    xlink:href="http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack"
                    >http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack</link> to
                subscribe or view the archives.
                You may be interested in the other mailing lists for
                specific projects or development - these can be found
                    <link
                    xlink:href="http://wiki.openstack.org/MailingLists"
                    >on the wiki</link>. A description of all the
                additional mailing lists is available at

        <title>The OpenStack Wiki search</title>
        <para>The <link xlink:href="http://wiki.openstack.org/">OpenStack wiki</link> contains content
        on a broad range of topics, but some of it sits a bit below the surface. Fortunately, the wiki
        search feature is very powerful in that it can do both searches by title and by content. If
        you are searching for specific information, say about "networking" or "api" for nova, you can
        find lots of content using the search feature. More is being added all the time, so be sure to
        check back often. You can find the search box in the upper right hand corner of any OpenStack wiki
        page.</para></simplesect>
    <simplesect><title>The Launchpad Bugs area</title>
    <para>So you think you've found a bug. That's great! Seriously, it is. The OpenStack community
                values your setup and testing efforts and wants your feedback. To log a bug you must
                have a Launchpad account, so sign up at https://launchpad.net/+login if you do not
                already have a Launchpad ID. You can view existing bugs and report your bug in the
                Launchpad Bugs area. It is suggested that you first use the search facility to see
                if the bug you found has already been reported (or even better, already fixed). If
                it still seems like your bug is new or unreported then it is time to fill out a bug
                report.</para>

            <title>The OpenStack IRC channel</title>
            <para>The OpenStack community lives and breathes in the
                #openstack IRC channel on the Freenode network. You
                can come by to hang out, ask questions, or get
                immediate feedback for urgent and pressing issues. To
                get into the IRC channel you need to install an IRC
                client or use a browser-based client by going to
                http://webchat.freenode.net/. You can also use
                Colloquy (Mac OS X, http://colloquy.info/) or mIRC
                (Windows, http://www.mirc.com/) or XChat (Linux). When
                you are in the IRC channel and want to share code or
                command output, the generally accepted method is to
                use a Paste Bin, the OpenStack project has one at
                http://paste.openstack.org. Just paste your longer
                amounts of text or logs in the web form and you get a
                URL you can then paste into the channel. The OpenStack
                IRC channel is: #openstack on irc.freenode.net. A list
                of all the OpenStack-related IRC channels is at <link
                    xlink:href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/IRC"
                    >https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/IRC</link>.</para>
