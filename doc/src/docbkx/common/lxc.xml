  <title>LXC (Linux containers)</title>
  <para>LXC (also known as Linux containers) is a virtualization technology that works at the
    operating system level. This is different from hardware virtualization, the approach used by
    other hypervisors such as KVM, Xen, and VMWare.</para>
  <note><para>Some OpenStack Compute features may be missing when running with LXC as the hypervisor. See
      the <link xlink:href="http://wiki.openstack.org/HypervisorSupportMatrix">hypervisor support
        matrix</link> for details.</para></note>
  <para>To enable LXC, ensure the following options are set in
      <filename>/etc/nova/nova.conf</filename> on all hosts running the <systemitem class="service"
      >nova-compute</systemitem>
    service.<programlisting>connection_type=libvirt
libvirt_type=lxc</programlisting></para>
  <para>On Ubuntu 12.04, enable LXC support in OpenStack by installing the
      <literal>nova-compute-lxc</literal> package.</para>
