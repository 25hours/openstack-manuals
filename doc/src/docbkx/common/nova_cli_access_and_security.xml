    <title>Set up access and security</title>
    <para>Before you launch a virtual machine, you can add security
        group rules to enable users to ping and SSH to the instances.
        To do so, you either add rules to the default security group
        or add a security group with rules.</para>
    <para>A security group is a named collection of network access
        rules that you use to limit the types of traffic that have
        access to instances. When you launch an instance, you can
        assign it to one or more security groups. The associated rules
        in each security group control the traffic to instances in the
        group. Any incoming traffic that is not matched by a rule is
        denied access by default. You can add rules to or remove rules from a
        security group. Rules are automatically enforced as soon as
        you create or modify them.</para>
    <para>Keypairs are SSH credentials that are injected into images
        when they are launched. For this to work, the image must
        contain the <literal>cloud-init</literal> package.</para>
