    <title>QEMU</title>
<para>From the perspective of the Compute service, the QEMU hypervisor is very similar to the KVM
        hypervisor. Both are controlled through libvirt, both support the same feature set, and all
        virtual machine images that are compatible with KVM are also compatible with QEMU. The main
        difference is that QEMU does not support native virtualization. Consequently, QEMU has worse
        performance than KVM and is a poor choice for a production deployment.</para>

    <para>KVM requires hardware support for acceleration. If hardware support is not available
        (e.g., if you are running Compute inside of a VM and the hypervisor does not expose the
        required hardware support), you can use QEMU instead. KVM and QEMU have the same level of
        support in OpenStack, but KVM will provide better performance. To enable
        QEMU:<programlisting>connection_type=libvirt
libvirt_type=qemu</programlisting>

    The QEMU hypervisor supports the following virtual machine image formats:<itemizedlist>
