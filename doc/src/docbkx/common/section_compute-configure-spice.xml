  <title>Spice Console</title>
  <para>OpenStack Compute has long had support for VNC consoles to
    guests. The VNC protocol is fairly limited, lacking support for
    multiple monitors, bi-directional audio, reliable cut+paste, video
    streaming and more. SPICE is a new protocol which aims to address
    all the limitations in VNC, to provide good remote desktop
    support.</para>
  <para>SPICE support in OpenStack Compute shares a similar
    architecture to the VNC implementation. The OpenStack Dashboard
    uses a SPICE-HTML5 widget in its console tab, that communicates to
    the <literal>nova-spicehtml5proxy</literal> service using
    SPICE-over-websockets. The <literal>nova-spicehtml5proxy</literal>
    service communicates directly with the hypervisor process using SPICE.<note>
      <para>If Spice is not configured correctly, Compute will fall
        back upon VNC.</para>

              you cannot specify a specific IP address for <literal>server_listen</literal>,
              because that IP address will not exist on the destination host.</para></note>-->
