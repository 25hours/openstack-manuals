    <para>OpenStack Compute supports the VMware vSphere product family. This section describes the
      additional configuration required to launch VMWare-based virtual machine images. vSphere
      versions 4.1 and greater are supported.</para>
    <para>There are two OpenStack Compute drivers that can be used with vSphere:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>vmwareapi.VMwareVCDriver: a driver that lets <systemitem class="service"
            >nova-compute</systemitem> communicate with a VMware vCenter server managing a cluster
          of ESX hosts. With this driver and access to shared storage, advanced vSphere features
          like vMotion, High Availability, and Dynamic Resource Scheduling (DRS) are available. With
          this driver, one <systemitem class="service">nova-compute</systemitem> service is run per
          vCenter cluster.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>vmwareapi.VMwareESXDriver: a driver that lets <systemitem class="service"
            >nova-compute</systemitem> communicate directly to an ESX host, but does not support
          advanced VMware features. With this driver, one <systemitem class="service"
            >nova-compute</systemitem> service is run per ESX host.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

  <section xml:id="vmware-prereqs">
    <title>Prerequisites</title>
    <para>You will need to install the following software installed on each <systemitem
        class="service">nova-compute</systemitem> node:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>python-suds: This software is needed by the <systemitem class="service"
            >nova-compute</systemitem> service to communicate with vSphere APIs. If not installed,
          the "<systemitem class="service">nova-compute</systemitem>" service shuts down with the
          message: "Unable to import suds".</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Tomcat server: This is required to serve up a local version of the vSphere WSDL file
          (see below).</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>On ubuntu, these packages can be installed by running:</para>
    <screen>sudo apt-get install python-suds tomcat6 </screen>
    <para>Next, download the SDK from <link
        xlink:href="http://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vc-sdk/"
        >http://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vc-sdk/</link> and copy it into
        <filename>/var/lib/tomcat6/webapps</filename>. You should ensure that the WSDL is available,
      in eg <filename> /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/vmware/SDK/wsdl/vim25/vimService.wsdl</filename>.
      Below we will point nova.conf to fetch this WSDL file from Tomcat using a URL pointing to
      localhost.</para>

      <title>VMWareVCDriver configuration options</title>
      <para>When using the VMwareVCDriver (i.e., vCenter) with OpenStack Compute, nova.conf must
        include the following VMWare-specific config options:</para>

      <programlisting>compute_driver=vmwareapi.VMwareVCDriver
vmwareapi_host_ip=&lt;vCenter host IP&gt;
vmwareapi_host_username=&lt; vCenter username&gt;

vmwareapi_wsdl_loc=http://127.0.0.1:8080/vmware/SDK/wsdl/vim25/vimService.wsdl
</programlisting>
      <para>Remember that you will have only one <systemitem class="service"
          >nova-compute</systemitem> service per cluster. It is recommended that this host run as a
        VM with high-availability enabled as part of that same cluster.</para>
      <para>Also note that many of the nova.conf options mentioned elsewhere in this document that
        are relevant to libvirt do not apply to using this driver.</para>

    <section xml:id="VMwareVCDriver_limitations">
      <title>Requirements + Limitations</title>
      <para>The VMwareVCDriver is new in Grizzly, and as a result there are some important
        deployment requirements and limitations to be aware of. In many cases, these items will be
        addressed in future releases.</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Each cluster can only be configured with a single Datastore. If multiple Datastores
            are configured, the first one returned via the vSphere API will be used.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Because a single <systemitem class="service">nova-compute</systemitem> is used per
            cluster, the nova-scheduler views this as a single host with resources amounting to the
            aggregate resources of all ESX hosts managed by the cluster. This may result in
            unexpected behavior depending on your choice of scheduler.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Security Groups are not supported if Nova-Network is used. Security Groups are only
            supported if the VMware driver is used in conjunction with the the OpenStack Networking
            Service running the Nicira NVP plugin.</para>

      <title>Requirements + Limitations</title>
      <para>The ESXDriver is unable to take advantage of many of the advanced capabilities

        Resource Scheduler (DRS).</para>

  <section xml:id="VMWare_images">
    <title>Images with VMware vSphere</title>
    <para>When using either VMware driver, images should be uploaded to the OpenStack Image Service
      in the VMDK format. Both thick and thin images are currently supported and all images must be
      flat (i.e. contained within 1 file). For example</para>
    <para>To load a thick image with a SCSI adaptor:</para>
    <screen>glance image-create name="ubuntu-thick-scsi" disk_format=vmdk container_format=bare \
is_public=true --property vmware_adaptertype="lsiLogic" \
--property vmware_disktype="preallocated" \
--property vmware_ostype="ubuntu64Guest" &lt; ubuntuLTS-flat.vmdk </screen>
    <para>To load a thin image with an IDE adaptor:</para>
    <screen>glance image-create name="unbuntu-thin-ide" disk_format=vmdk container_format=bare \
is_public=true --property vmware_adaptertype="ide" \
--property vmware_disktype="thin" \
--property vmware_ostype="ubuntu64Guest" &lt; unbuntuLTS-thin-flat.vmdk </screen>
    <para>The complete list of supported vmware disk properties is documented in the Image
      Management section. It's critical that the adaptertype is correct; In fact, the image will not
      boot with the incorrect adaptertype. If you have the meta-data VMDK file the the
      ddb.adapterType property specifies the adaptertype. The default adaptertype is "lsilogic"
      which is SCSI.</para>

      Service.</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>If using nova-network with the FlatManager or FlatDHCPManager, before provisioning
          VMs, create a port group with the same name as the 'flat_network_bridge' value in

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>If using nova-network with the VlanManager, before provisioning VMs, make sure the
          'vmwareapi_vlan_interface' configuration option is set to match the ESX host interface
          that will handle VLAN-tagged VM traffic. OpenStack Compute will automatically create the
          corresponding port groups.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>If using the OpenStack Networking Service, before provisioning VMs, create a port group
          with the same name as the 'vmware.integration_bridge' value in nova.conf (default is

  <section xml:id="VMWare_volumes">
    <title>Volumes with VMware vSphere</title>
    <para>The VMware driver has limited support for attaching Volumes from the OpenStack Block
      Storage service, supporting attachments only if the volume driver type is 'iscsi'. There is no
      support for volumes based on vCenter Datastores in this release.</para>
