    <para>OpenStack Compute supports the VMware vSphere product family. This section describes the
      additional configuration required to launch VMWare-based virtual machine images. vSphere
      versions 4.1 and greater are supported.</para>
    <para>There are two OpenStack Compute drivers that can be used with vSphere:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>vmwareapi.VMwareVCDriver: a driver that lets <systemitem class="service"
            >nova-compute</systemitem> communicate with a VMware vCenter server managing a cluster
          of ESX hosts. With this driver and access to shared storage, advanced vSphere features
          like vMotion, High Availability, and Dynamic Resource Scheduling (DRS) are available. With
          this driver, one <systemitem class="service">nova-compute</systemitem> service is run per
          vCenter cluster.</para>

        <para>vmwareapi.VMwareESXDriver: a driver that lets <systemitem class="service"

          advanced VMware features. With this driver, one <systemitem class="service"

      <para>When using the VMwareVCDriver (i.e., vCenter) with OpenStack Compute, nova.conf must
        include the following VMWare-specific config options:</para>

      <programlisting language="ini">[DEFAULT]
compute_driver=vmwareapi.VMwareVCDriver

[vmware]
host_ip=&lt;vCenter host IP&gt;
host_username=&lt; vCenter username&gt;
host_password=&lt; vCenter password&gt;
cluster_name=&lt; vCenter cluster name&gt;
wsdl_location=http://127.0.0.1:8080/vmware/SDK/wsdl/vim25/vimService.wsdl</programlisting>
      <para>Remember that you will have only one <systemitem class="service"
          >nova-compute</systemitem> service per cluster. It is recommended that this host run as a
        VM with high-availability enabled as part of that same cluster.</para>
      <para>Also note that many of the nova.conf options mentioned elsewhere in this document that
        are relevant to libvirt do not apply to using this driver.</para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="vmware-wsdl-workaround">
      <title>vSphere 5.0 (and below) additional setup</title>
      <para>Users of vSphere 5.0 or earlier will need to locally host their WSDL files.
        These steps are applicable for vCenter 5.0 or ESXi 5.0 and you may
        accomplish this by either mirroring the WSDL from the vCenter or ESXi
        server you intend on using, or you may download the SDK directly from VMware.
        These are both workaround steps used to fix a <link
         xlink:href="http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=2010507">known issue</link> with the WSDL that was resolved in later versions.</para>
      <para>To mirror the WSDL from vCenter (or ESXi), create a local file system directory
        to hold the WSDL files in. You'll need to set the IP address for your vCenter or
        ESXi host that you'll be mirroring the files from. Setting the following shell
        variable will let you cut and paste commands from these instructions.
        <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>export VMWAREAPI_IP=&lt;your_vsphere_host_ip&gt;</userinput></screen>
        <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>mkdir -p /opt/stack/vmware/wsdl/5.0</userinput></screen>
        Change into the new directory.
        <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>cd /opt/stack/vmware/wsdl/5.0</userinput></screen>
        Next, we'll mirror all the WSDL files. For that we need a tool that can download the files.
        <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>sudo apt-get install wget</userinput></screen>
        Now that we have a tool to fetch the files for us, we can download them to the local
        file cache.
        <programlisting language="bash">wget  --no-check-certificate https://$VMWAREAPI_IP/sdk/vimService.wsdl
        wget  --no-check-certificate https://$VMWAREAPI_IP/sdk/vim.wsdl
        wget  --no-check-certificate https://$VMWAREAPI_IP/sdk/core-types.xsd
        wget  --no-check-certificate https://$VMWAREAPI_IP/sdk/query-messagetypes.xsd
        wget  --no-check-certificate https://$VMWAREAPI_IP/sdk/query-types.xsd
        wget  --no-check-certificate https://$VMWAREAPI_IP/sdk/vim-messagetypes.xsd
        wget  --no-check-certificate https://$VMWAREAPI_IP/sdk/reflect-messagetypes.xsd
        wget  --no-check-certificate https://$VMWAREAPI_IP/sdk/reflect-types.xsd</programlisting>
        There will be two files that did not fetch properly reflect-types.xsd and
        reflect-messagetypes.xsd these two files will need to be stubbed out. The
        following XML listing can be used to replace the missing file content. The
        XML parser underneath Python can be very particular and if you put a space
        in the wrong place it can break the parser. Copy the contents below carefully
        and watch the formatting carefully.
        <programlisting language="xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
            &lt;schema
               targetNamespace="urn:reflect"
               xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
               xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
               elementFormDefault="qualified"&gt;
            &lt;/schema&gt;
        </programlisting>
        Now that the files are locally present, you will need to tell the driver
        to look for the SOAP service WSDLs in the local file system and not on the
        remote vSphere server. The following setting should be added to the nova.conf
        for your nova-compute node.
        <programlisting language="ini">vmwareapi_wsdl_loc=file:///opt/stack/vmware/wsdl/5.0/vimService.wsdl
        </programlisting>
        </para>
      <para>Alternatively, download the version appropriate SDK from <link
        xlink:href="http://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vc-sdk/"
        >http://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vc-sdk/</link> and copy it into
        <filename>/opt/stack/vmware</filename>. You should ensure that the WSDL is available,
        in eg <filename> /opt/stack/vmware/SDK/wsdl/vim25/vimService.wsdl</filename>.
        Below we will point nova.conf to fetch this WSDL file from the local file system
        using a URL.</para>
        <para>When using the VMwareVCDriver (i.e., vCenter) with OpenStack Compute with vSphere
        version 5.0 or below, nova.conf must include the following extra config option:</para>

      <title>Requirements + Limitations</title>
      <para>The VMwareVCDriver is new in Grizzly, and as a result there are some important
        deployment requirements and limitations to be aware of. In many cases, these items will be
        addressed in future releases.</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Each cluster can only be configured with a single Datastore. If multiple Datastores
            are configured, the first one returned via the vSphere API will be used.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Because a single <systemitem class="service">nova-compute</systemitem> is used per
            cluster, the nova-scheduler views this as a single host with resources amounting to the
            aggregate resources of all ESX hosts managed by the cluster. This may result in
            unexpected behavior depending on your choice of scheduler.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Security Groups are not supported if Nova-Network is used. Security Groups are only
            supported if the VMware driver is used in conjunction with the OpenStack Networking
            Service running the Nicira NVP plugin.</para>

  <section xml:id="VMWare_images">
    <title>Images with VMware vSphere</title>
    <para>When using either VMware driver, images should be uploaded to the OpenStack Image Service
      in the VMDK format. Both thick and thin images are currently supported and all images must be
      flat (i.e. contained within 1 file). For example</para>
    <para>To load a thick image with a SCSI adaptor:</para>
    <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>glance image-create name="ubuntu-thick-scsi" disk_format=vmdk container_format=bare \
is_public=true --property vmware_adaptertype="lsiLogic" \
--property vmware_disktype="preallocated" \
--property vmware_ostype="ubuntu64Guest" &lt; ubuntuLTS-flat.vmdk</userinput></screen>
    <para>To load a thin image with an IDE adaptor:</para>
    <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>glance image-create name="unbuntu-thin-ide" disk_format=vmdk container_format=bare \

--property vmware_ostype="ubuntu64Guest" &lt; unbuntuLTS-thin-flat.vmdk</userinput></screen>
    <para>The complete list of supported vmware disk properties is documented in the Image
      Management section. It's critical that the adaptertype is correct; In fact, the image will not
      boot with the incorrect adaptertype. If you have the meta-data VMDK file the
      ddb.adapterType property specifies the adaptertype. The default adaptertype is "lsilogic"
      which is SCSI.</para>
