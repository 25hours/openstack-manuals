<title>Dom0 Modifications for Resize/Migration Support</title>
    <para>To get resize to work with XenServer (and XCP) you need to:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>Establish a root trust between all hypervisor nodes of your
            deployment:</para>

            <para>You can do so by generating an ssh key-pair (with
                    <command>ssh-keygen</command>) and then ensuring
                that each of your dom0's
                    <filename>authorized_keys</filename> file (located
                in <filename>/root/.ssh/authorized_keys</filename>)
                contains the public key fingerprint (located in
                    <filename>/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</filename>).</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Provide an <filename>/images</filename> mount point
                to your hypervisor's dom0:</para>

            <para>Dom0 space is a premium so creating a directory in
                dom0 is kind of dangerous, and almost surely bound to
                fail especially when resizing big servers. The least
                you can do is to symlink <filename>/images</filename>
                to your local storage SR. The instructions below work
                for an English-based installation of XenServer (and
                XCP) and in the case of ext3 based SR (with which the
                resize functionality is known to work
                correctly).</para>
