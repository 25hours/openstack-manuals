    <title>Support</title>
    <para>Online resources aid in supporting OpenStack and the community members are willing and able to answer questions and help with bug suspicions. We are constantly improving and adding to the main features of OpenStack, but if you have any problems, do not hesitate to ask. Here are some ideas for supporting OpenStack and troubleshooting your existing installations.</para>

        <simplesect><title>The Launchpad Answers area</title>
      <para>During setup or testing, you may have questions about how to do something, or end up in
                a situation where you can't seem to get a feature to work correctly. One place to
                look for help is the Answers section on Launchpad. Launchpad is the "home" for the
                project code and its developers and thus is a natural place to ask about the
                project. When visiting the Answers section, it is usually good to at least scan over
                recently asked questions to see if your question has already been answered. If that
                is not the case, then proceed to adding a new question. Be sure you give a clear,
                concise summary in the title and provide as much detail as possible in the
                description. Paste in your command output or stack traces, link to screenshots, and
                so on. The Launchpad Answers areas are available here: </para>

        <simplesect><title>OpenStack mailing list</title>
        <para>Posting your question or scenario to the OpenStack mailing list is a great way to get
                answers and insights. You can learn from and help others who may have the same
                scenario as you. Go to <link xlink:href="https://launchpad.net/~openstack"
                    >https://launchpad.net/~openstack</link> and click "Subscribe to mailing list"
                or view the archives at <link xlink:href="https://lists.launchpad.net/openstack/"
                    >https://lists.launchpad.net/openstack/</link>. You may be interested in the other 
		mailing lists for specific projects or development - these can be found 
		<link xlink:href="http://wiki.openstack.org/MailingLists">on the wiki</link>. </para></simplesect><simplesect>
        <title>The OpenStack Wiki search </title>
        <para>The <link xlink:href="http://wiki.openstack.org/">OpenStack wiki</link> contains content
        on a broad range of topics, but some of it sits a bit below the surface. Fortunately, the wiki 
        search feature is very powerful in that it can do both searches by title and by content. If 
        you are searching for specific information, say about "networking" or "api" for nova, you can 
        find lots of content using the search feature. More is being added all the time, so be sure to 
        check back often. You can find the search box in the upper right hand corner of any OpenStack wiki
        page. </para></simplesect>
    <simplesect><title>The Launchpad Bugs area </title>
    <para>So you think you've found a bug. That's great! Seriously, it is. The OpenStack community
                values your setup and testing efforts and wants your feedback. To log a bug you must
                have a Launchpad account, so sign up at https://launchpad.net/+login if you do not
                already have a Launchpad ID. You can view existing bugs and report your bug in the
                Launchpad Bugs area. It is suggested that you first use the search facility to see
                if the bug you found has already been reported (or even better, already fixed). If
                it still seems like your bug is new or unreported then it is time to fill out a bug
                report. </para>
            <para>Some tips: </para>
                <itemizedlist><listitem><para>Give a clear, concise summary! </para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>Provide as much detail as possible
                in the description. Paste in your command output or stack traces, link to
                screenshots, etc. </para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>Be sure to include what version of the software you are using.
                This is especially critical if you are using a development branch eg. "Folsom
                release" vs git commit bc79c3ecc55929bac585d04a03475b72e06a3208. </para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>Any deployment specific info is helpful as well. eg.
                Ubuntu 12.04, multi-node install.</para></listitem> </itemizedlist>

            <simplesect><title>The OpenStack IRC channel </title>
            <para>The OpenStack community lives and breathes in the #openstack IRC channel on the
                Freenode network. You can come by to hang out, ask questions, or get immediate
                feedback for urgent and pressing issues. To get into the IRC channel you need to
                install an IRC client or use a browser-based client by going to
                http://webchat.freenode.net/. You can also use Colloquy (Mac OS X,
                http://colloquy.info/) or mIRC (Windows, http://www.mirc.com/) or XChat (Linux).
                When you are in the IRC channel and want to share code or command output, the
                generally accepted method is to use a Paste Bin, the OpenStack project has one at
                http://paste.openstack.org. Just paste your longer amounts of text or logs in the
                web form and you get a URL you can then paste into the channel. The OpenStack IRC
                channel is: #openstack on irc.freenode.net. </para></simplesect>
