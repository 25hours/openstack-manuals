    <title>Configuring Tenant-specific Storage Locations for Images
        with Object Storage</title>
    <para>For some deployers, storing all images in a single place for
        all tenants and users to access is not ideal. To enable access
        control to specific images for cloud users, you can configure
        the Image service with the ability to store image data in the
        image owner-specific locations.</para>
    <para>These are the relevant configuration options in the
            <filename>glance-api.conf</filename> file:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>swift_store_multi_tenant: this must be set to 'True'
                to enable tenant-specific storage locations (it
                defaults to 'False').</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>swift_store_admin_tenants: this is a list of
                tenants, referenced by id, that should be granted read
                and write access to all Object Storage containers
                created by the Image service.</para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Assuming you configured 'swift' as your default_store in
            <filename>glance-api.conf</filename> and you enable this
        feature as described above, images will be stored in an Object
        Storage service (swift) endpoint pulled from the authenticated
        user's service_catalog. The created image data will only be
        accessible through the Image service by the tenant that owns
        it and any tenants defined in swift_store_admin_tenants that
        are identified as having admin-level accounts.</para>
