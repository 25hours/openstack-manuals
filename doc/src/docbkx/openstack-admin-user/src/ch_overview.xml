    <title>How can I use an OpenStack cloud?</title>
    <?dbhtml stop-chunking?>
    <para>As an OpenStack cloud admin user, you can manage projects and users, images, or flavors, and set quotas. The examples in this guide
        show you how to complete these tasks by using the OpenStack dashboard and command-line clients. The
        dashboard, also known as <link
            xlink:href="https://github.com/openstack/horizon/"
            >horizon</link>, is a Web-based graphical interface. The
        command-line clients let you run simple commands to create and
        manage resources in a cloud and automate tasks by using
        scripts. Each of the core OpenStack projects has its own
        command-line client.</para>
    <para>You
        can modify these examples for your specific use cases.</para>
    <para>In addition to these ways of interacting with a cloud, you
        can access the OpenStack APIs indirectly through <link
            xlink:href="http://curl.haxx.se/">cURL</link> commands or
        open SDKs, or directly through the APIs. You can automate
        access or build tools to manage resources and services by
        using the native OpenStack APIs or the EC2 compatibility
        API.</para>
    <para>To use the OpenStack APIs, it helps to be familiar with
        HTTP/1.1, RESTful web services, the OpenStack services, and
        JSON or XML data serialization formats.</para>
