    <para>In an OpenStack cloud, you can manage projects and users
        independently from each other.</para>
    <para>Projects represent different organizational units in the
        cloud to which you can assign users.</para>
    <para>Cloud admin users perform both project and user management
        tasks.</para>
    <para>During the basic system set up, the cloud operator must
        define at least one project, user, and role. The operator
        links the role to the user and the user to the project. Roles
        define which actions users can perform.</para>
    <para>As an admin user, you can create additional projects and
        users as needed.</para>
    <para>Learn how to add, update, and delete projects and users,
        assign users to one or more projects, and change or remove the
        assignment. To enable or temporarily disable a project or
        user, update that project or user.</para>
