    <para>The OpenStack Block Storage service enables you to add extra
        block-level storage to your OpenStack Compute instances. This
        service is similar to the Amazon EC2 Elastic Block Storage
        (EBS) offering.</para>
    <para>The default OpenStack Block Storage service implementation
        is an iSCSI solution that uses Logical Volume Manager (LVM)
        for Linux.</para>
    <note>
        <para>The OpenStack Block Storage service is not a shared
            storage solution like SAN of NFS, where you can attach a
            volume to multiple servers. With the OpenStack Block
            Storage service, you can attach a volume to only one
            instance at a time. </para>
        <para>The OpenStack Block Storage service also provides
            drivers that enable you to use several vendors' back-end
            storage devices, in addition to or instead of the base LVM
            implementation.</para>
    </note>
    <para>The following high-level procedure shows you how to create
        and attach a volume to a server instance. </para>
    <procedure>
        <title>To create and attach a volume to a server
            instance:</title>
        <para>You must configure both OpenStack Compute and the
            OpenStack Block Storage service through the
                <filename>cinder.conf</filename> file.</para>
        <step>

            <para>Create a volume is created through the
                    <command>cinder create</command> command. This
                command creates an LV into the volume group (VG)
                "cinder-volumes." </para>
        </step>

        <step>
            <para>Attach the volume to an instance through the
                    <command>nova volume-attach</command> command.
                This command creates a unique iSCSI IQN that is
                exposed to the compute node.</para>
        </step>
        <step>
            <para>The compute node, which runs the instance, now has
                an active ISCSI session and new local storage (usually
                a /dev/sdX disk).</para>
        </step>
        <step>
            <para>libvirt uses that local storage as storage for the
                instance. The instance get a new disk, usually a
                /dev/vdX disk.</para>
