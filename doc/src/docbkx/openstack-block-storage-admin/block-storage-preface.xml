    <para>The OpenStack Block Storage service works though the
        interaction of a series of daemon processes named cinder-*
        that reside persistently on the host machine or machines. The
        binaries can all be run from a single node, or spread across
        multiple nodes. They can also be run on the same node as other
        OpenStack services.</para>
    <para>To administer the OpenStack Block Storage service, it is
        helpful to understand a number of concepts. You must make
        certain choices when you configure the Block Storage service
        in OpenStack. The bulk of the options come down to two
        choices, single node or multi-node install. You can read a
        longer discussion about storage decisions in <link
