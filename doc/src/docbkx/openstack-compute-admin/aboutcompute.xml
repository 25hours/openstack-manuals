    <title>Introduction to OpenStack Compute</title>
    <para>OpenStack Compute gives you a tool to orchestrate a cloud, including running instances,
        managing networks, and controlling access to the cloud through users and projects. The
        underlying open source project's name is Nova, and it provides the software that can control
        an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing platform. It is similar in scope to
        Amazon EC2 and Rackspace Cloud Servers. OpenStack Compute does not include any
        virtualization software; rather it defines drivers that interact with underlying
        virtualization mechanisms that run on your host operating system, and exposes functionality
        over a web-based API.</para>

        <title>Hypervisors</title>
    
    <para>OpenStack Compute requires a hypervisor and Compute controls the hypervisors through an
            API server. The process for selecting a hypervisor usually means prioritizing and making
            decisions based on budget and resource constraints as well as the inevitable list of
            supported features and required technical specifications. The majority of development is
            done with the KVM and Xen-based hypervisors. Refer to <link

        features and support across the hypervisors.  </para>
        <para>With OpenStack Compute, you can orchestrate clouds using multiple hypervisors in
            different zones. The types of virtualization standards that may be used with Compute

    <section xml:id="users-and-projects">
        <title>Users and Projects (Tenants)</title>
        <para>The OpenStack Compute system is designed to be used by many different cloud computing
            consumers or customers, basically tenants on a shared system, using role-based access
            assignments. With the use of the Identity Service, the issuing of a token also issues
            the roles assigned to the user, and the Identity Service calls projects tenants. Roles
            control the actions that a user is allowed to perform. For example, a user cannot
            allocate a public IP without the netadmin or admin role when the system is set up
            according to those rules. There are both global roles and per-project (tenant) role
            assignments. A user's access to particular images is limited by project, but the access
            key and secret key are assigned per user. Key pairs granting access to an instance are
            enabled per user, but quotas to control resource consumption across available hardware
            resources are per project. </para>
        
        <para>With the "--use_deprecated_auth" flag in place, OpenStack Compute uses a rights
            management system that employs a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model and supports the
            following five roles:</para>
       <itemizedlist> 
        <listitem><para>Cloud Administrator (admin): Global role. Users of this class enjoy complete system access.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>IT Security (itsec): Global role. This role is limited to IT security personnel. It permits role holders to
                    quarantine instances on any project.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Project Manager (projectmanager): Project role. The default for project owners, this role affords users the
                    ability to add other users to a project, interact with project images, and
                    launch and terminate instances.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Network Administrator (netadmin): Project role. Users with this role are permitted to allocate and assign
                    publicly accessible IP addresses as well as create and modify firewall
                    rules.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Developer (developer): Project role. This is a general purpose role that is assigned to users by
                    default.</para></listitem></itemizedlist>
<para>While the original EC2 API supports users, OpenStack Compute adds the concept of projects, or
            tenants if your deployment uses the Identity Service (Keystone). Projects and tenants
            are isolated resource containers forming the principal organizational structure within
            Nova. They consist of a separate VLAN, volumes, instances, images, keys, and users. A
            user can specify which project or tenant he or she wishes to be known as by appending
            :project_id to his or her access key. If no project or tenant is specified in the API
            request, Compute attempts to use a project with the same id as the user. </para>
        <para>For projects (tenants), quota controls are available to limit the: <itemizedlist>

    </section><section xml:id="images-and-instances">
            <title>Images and Instances</title>
        
        <para>An image is a file containing information about a virtual disk that completely
            replicates all information about a working computer at a point in time including
            operating system information and file system information. Compute can use certificate
            management for decrypting bundled images. With the deprecated auth system, you can use
            the euca2ools command-line tools distributed by the Eucalyptus Team for adding,
            bundling, and deleting images. When using the Image Service (Keystone), you can use the
            nova-client command-line tool for working with images and the glance-client command-line
            tool for uploading images to the Image Service. </para>
        <para>There are two methods for managing images. Images can be served through the OpenStack
            Image Service, a project that is named Glance, or use the nova-objectstore service.
            Compute defaults to being configured to use the Image Service. With an OpenStack Image
            Service server in place, the Image Service fetches the image on to the host machine and
            then OpenStack Compute boots the image from the host machine. To place images into the
            service, you would use a REST interface to stream them, and the service, in turn,
            streams that into a back end which could be S3, OpenStack Object Storage (which can use
            an S3), or the local file system on the server where OpenStack Image Service is
            installed.</para>
        <para>An instance is a running virtual machine within the cloud. An instance has a life
            cycle that is controlled by OpenStack Compute. Compute creates the instances and it is
            responsible for building a disk image, launching it, reporting the state, attaching
            persistent storage, and terminating it. </para>
    </section><section xml:id="system-architecture">
        <title>System Architecture</title><para>OpenStack Compute consists of several main components. A "cloud controller" contains many of
            these components, and it represents the global state and interacts with all other
            components. An API Server acts as the web services front end for the cloud controller.
            The compute controller provides compute server resources and typically contains the
            compute service, The Object Store component optionally provides storage services. An
            auth manager provides authentication and authorization services when used with the
            Compute system, or you can use the Identity Service (keystone) as a separate
            authentication service. A volume controller provides fast and permanent block-level
            storage for the compute servers. A network controller provides virtual networks to
            enable compute servers to interact with each other and with the public network. A
            scheduler selects the most suitable compute controller to host an instance. </para><para>OpenStack Compute is built on a shared-nothing, messaging-based architecture. You can run all
            of the major components on multiple servers including a compute controller, volume
            controller, network controller, and object store (or image service). A cloud controller
            communicates with the internal object store via HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol), but
            it communicates with a scheduler, network controller, and volume controller via AMQP
            (Advanced Message Queue Protocol). To avoid blocking each component while waiting for a
            response, OpenStack Compute uses asynchronous calls, with a call-back that gets
            triggered when a response is received.</para>
        
        <para>To achieve the shared-nothing property with multiple copies of the same component, OpenStack Compute keeps all the cloud system state in a database.</para></section>
    <section xml:id="storage-and-openstack-compute">
      <title>Block Storage and OpenStack Compute</title> 

      <para>OpenStack provides two classes of block storage,
      "ephemeral" storage and persistent "volumes".  Ephemeral storage
      exists only for the life of an instance, it will persist across
      reboots of the guest operating system but when the instance is
      deleted so is the associated storage.  All instances have some
      ephemeral storage.  Volumes are persistent virtualized block
      devices independent of any particular instance.  Volumes may be
      attached to a single instance at a time, but may be detached or
      reattached to a different instance while retaining all data,
      much like a USB drive.</para>
      
      <simplesect xml:id="about-ephemeral-storage">
	<title>Ephemeral Storage</title>

	<para>Ephemeral storage is associated with a single unique
	instance.  Its size is defined by the flavor of the
	instance.</para>

	<para>Data on ephemeral storage ceases to exist when the
	instance it is associated with goes away. In the typical use
	case an instance's root filesystem is stored on ephemeral
	storage. This is often an unpleasant surprise for people
	unfamiliar with the cloud model of computing.</para>

	<para>In addition to the ephemeral root volume all flavors
	except the smallest, m1.tiny, provide an additional ephemeral
	block device varying from 20G for the m1.small through 160G
	for the m1.xlarge by default - these sizes are configurable.
	This is presented as a raw block device with no partition
	table or filesystem.  Cloud aware operating system images may
	discover, format, and mount this device.  For example the
	cloud-init package included in Ubuntu's stock cloud images
	will format this space as an ext3 filesystem and mount it on
	/mnt. It is important to note this a feature of the guest
	operating system. OpenStack only provisions the raw
	storage.</para>

      </simplesect>

      <simplesect xml:id="about-persistent-storage">
	<title>Volume Storage</title>

	<para>Volume storage is independent or any particular instance
	and is persistent. Volumes are user created and within quota
	and availability limits may be of any arbitrary size.</para>

	<para>When first created volumes are raw block devices with no
	partition table and no filesystem.  They must be attached to
	an instance to be partitioned and/or formatted.  Once this is
	done they may be used much like an external disk drive.
	Volumes may attached to only one instance at a time, but may
	be detached and reattached to either the same or different
	instances.</para>

	<para>It is possible to configure a volume so that it is
	bootable and provides a persistent virtual instance similar to
	traditional non-cloud based virtualization systems.  In this
	use case the resulting instance may sill have ephemeral
	storage depending on the flavor selected, but the root
	filesystem (and possibly others) will be on the persistent
	volume and thus state will be maintained even if the instance
	it shutdown.  Details of this configuration are discussed in
	the <link linkend="boot-from-volume">Boot From Volume</link>
	section of this manual.</para>

	<para>Volumes do not provide concurrent access from multiple
	instances.  For that you need either a traditional network
	filesystem like NFS or CIFS or a cluster filesystem such as
	GlusterFS.  These may be built within an OpenStack cluster or
	provisioned out side of it, but are not features provided by
	the OpenStack software.</para>
