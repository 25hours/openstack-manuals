    <title>Troubleshoot your cinder installation</title>
    <para> This section is intended to help solve some basic and common errors that are encountered
        during setup and configuration of Cinder. The focus here is on failed creation of volumes.
        The most important thing to know is where to look in case of a failure. There are two log
        files that are especially helpful in the case of a volume creation failure. The first is the
        cinder-api log, and the second is the cinder-volume log.</para>
    <para>The cinder-api log is useful in determining if you have
        endpoint or connectivity issues. If you send a request to
        create a volume and it fails, it's a good idea to look here
        first and see if the request even made it to the Cinder
        service. If the request seems to be logged, and there are no
        errors or trace-backs then you can move to the cinder-volume
        log and look for errors or trace-backs there.</para>
    <para>There are some common issues with both nova-volumes and
        Cinder on Folsom to look out for, the following refers to
        Cinder only, but is applicable to both Nova-Volume and Cinder
        unless otherwise specified.</para>

                with no error</emphasis></emphasis></para>
    <para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">state_path and volumes_dir settings</emphasis></para>
                <para>As of Folsom Cinder is using tgtd as the default
                    iscsi helper and implements persistent targets.
                    This means that in the case of a tgt restart or
                    even a node reboot your existing volumes on that
                    node will be restored automatically with their
                    original IQN.</para>
                <para>In order to make this possible the iSCSI target information needs to be stored
                    in a file on creation that can be queried in case of restart of the tgt daemon.
                    By default, Cinder uses a state_path variable, which if installing via Yum or
                    APT should be set to /var/lib/cinder/. The next part is the volumes_dir
                    variable, by default this just simply appends a "volumes" directory to the
                    state_path. The result is a file-tree /var/lib/cinder/volumes/.</para>
                <para>While this should all be handled for you by you installer, it can go wrong. If
                    you're having trouble creating volumes and this directory does not exist you
                    should see an error message in the cinder-volume log indicating that the
                    volumes_dir doesn't exist, and it should give you information to specify what
                    path exactly it was looking for.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">persistent tgt include file</emphasis></para>
                <para>Along with the volumes_dir mentioned above, the iSCSI target driver also needs
                    to be configured to look in the correct place for the persist files. This is a
                    simple entry in /etc/tgt/conf.d, and you should have created this when you went
                    through the install guide. If you haven't or you're running into issues, verify
                    that you have a file /etc/tgt/conf.d/cinder.conf (for Nova-Volumes, this will be
                    /etc//tgt/conf.d/nova.conf).</para>
                <para>If the files not there, you can create it easily by doing the
                    following:<programlisting>
sudo sh -c "echo 'include /var/lib/cinder/volumes/*' >> /etc/tgt/conf.d/cinder.conf"
                    </programlisting></para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="underline">No sign of create call in the cinder-api
                log</emphasis></emphasis></para>
    <para>This is most likely going to be a minor adjustment to you
            <filename>nova.conf </filename>file. Make sure that your
            <filename>nova.conf</filename> has the following
        entry:<programlisting>
volume_api_class=nova.volume.cinder.API
        </programlisting></para>
    <para>And make certain that you EXPLICITLY set enabled_apis as the default will include
        osapi_volume:<programlisting>
enabled_apis=ec2,osapi_compute,metadata
    </programlisting>
    </para>
