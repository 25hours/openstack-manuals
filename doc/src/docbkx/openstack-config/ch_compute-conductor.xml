The nova-conductor service is key to allowing OpenStack to function
without compute nodes accessing the database. Conceptually, it
implements a new layer on top of <systemitem class="service">nova-compute</systemitem>. It should not be
deployed on compute nodes, or else the security benefits of removing
database access from <systemitem class="service">nova-compute</systemitem> will be negated. Just like other
nova services such as <systemitem class="service">nova-api</systemitem> or nova-scheduler, it can be scaled
horizontally. You can run multiple instances of nova-conductor on
different machines as needed for scaling purposes.</para>
<para>
In the Grizzly release, the methods exposed by nova-conductor will
be relatively simple methods used by <systemitem class="service">nova-compute</systemitem> to offload its
 database operations.
Places where <systemitem class="service">nova-compute</systemitem> previously did database access will now be
 talking to nova-conductor. However, we have plans in the medium to
long term to move more and more of what is currently in <systemitem class="service">nova-compute</systemitem>
up to the nova-conductor layer. The compute service will start to
look like a less intelligent slave service to nova-conductor. The
conductor service will implement long running complex operations,
ensuring forward progress and graceful error handling.
This will be especially beneficial for operations that cross multiple
compute nodes, such as migrations or resizes
