    <para>OpenStack has two main methods for providing a remote
        console or remote desktop access to guest Virtual
        Machines. They are VNC, and SPICE HTML5 and can be used
        either through the OpenStack dashboard and the command
        line. Best practice is to select one or the other to
        run.</para>

  <title>Spice Console</title>
  <para>OpenStack Compute has long had support for VNC consoles to
    guests. The VNC protocol is fairly limited, lacking support for
    multiple monitors, bi-directional audio, reliable cut+paste, video
    streaming and more. SPICE is a new protocol which aims to address
    all the limitations in VNC, to provide good remote desktop
    support.</para>
  <para>SPICE support in OpenStack Compute shares a similar
    architecture to the VNC implementation. The OpenStack Dashboard
    uses a SPICE-HTML5 widget in its console tab, that communicates to
    the <literal>nova-spicehtml5proxy</literal> service using
    SPICE-over-websockets. The <literal>nova-spicehtml5proxy</literal>
    service communicates directly with the hypervisor process using
    SPICE.</para>
  <para>Options for configuring SPICE as the console for OpenStack Compute can be found below.</para>
