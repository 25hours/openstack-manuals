=== Highly available Glance API

Glance is the Image Delivery and Registring Service in OpenStack.
Making the Glance API service highly available in active / passive mode involves

* configuring Glance to listen on the VIP address,
* managing Glance API daemon with the Pacemaker cluster manager,
* configuring OpenStack services to use this IP address.

NOTE: Here is the http://docs.openstack.org/trunk/openstack-compute/install/apt/content/install-glance.html[documentation] for installing Glance API service.


==== Adding Glance API resource to Pacemaker

First of all, you need to download the resource agent to your system :
  
----
cd /usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/openstack
wget https://raw.github.com/madkiss/openstack-resource-agents/master/ocf/glance-api
chmod a+rx *
----

You may now proceed with adding the Pacemaker configuration for
Glance API resource. Connect to the Pacemaker cluster with +crm
configure+, and add the following cluster resources:

----
include::includes/pacemaker-glance_api.crm[]
----

This configuration creates

* +p_glance-api+, a resource for manage Glance API service

+crm configure+ supports batch input, so you may copy and paste the
above into your live pacemaker configuration, and then make changes as
required. For example, you may enter +edit p_ip_glance-api+ from the
+crm configure+ menu and edit the resource to match your preferred
virtual IP address.

Once completed, commit your configuration changes by entering +commit+
from the +crm configure+ menu. Pacemaker will then start the Glance API
service, and its dependent resources, on one of your nodes.

==== Configuring Glance API service

Edit +/etc/glance/glance-api.conf+ :
----
# We have to use MySQL connection to store datas :
sql_connection=mysql://glance:password@192.168.42.101/glance

# We bind Glance API to the VIP :
bind_host = 192.168.42.103

# Connect to Glance Registry service :
registry_host = 192.168.42.103

# We send notifications to High Available RabbitMQ :
notifier_strategy = rabbit
rabbit_host = 192.168.42.102
----


==== Configuring OpenStack Services to use High Available Glance API

Your OpenStack services must now point their Glance API configuration to
the highly available, virtual cluster IP address -- rather than a
Glance API server's physical IP address as you normally would.

For Nova, for example, if your Glance API service IP address is
192.168.42.104 as in the configuration explained here, you would use
the following line in your +nova.conf+ file :

----
glance_api_servers = 192.168.42.103
----

You need also to create the Glance API Endpoint with this IP.

NOTE : If you are using both private and public IP, you should create two Virtual IP and define your endpoint like this :
----
keystone endpoint-create --region $KEYSTONE_REGION --service-id $image-id --publicurl 'http://PUBLIC_VIP:9292/v2' --adminurl 'http://192.168.42.103:9292/v2' --internalurl 'http://192.168.42.103:9292/v2'
