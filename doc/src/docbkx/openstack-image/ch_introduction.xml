    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>An OpenStack Compute cloud is not very useful unless you have virtual machine images
        (which some people call "virtual appliances"). This guide describes how to obtain, create,
        and modify virtual machine images that are compatible with OpenStack.</para>
    <para>To keep these brief, we'll sometimes use the term "image" instead of "virtual machine
        image".</para>

        <title>What is a virtual machine image?</title>
        <para>A virtual machine image is a single file which contains a virtual disk that has a
            bootable operating system installed on it. </para>
        <para>Virtual machine images come in different formats, some
            of which are described below. In a later chapter, we'll
            describe how to convert between formats.</para>

    <simplesect>
        <title>Raw</title>
        <para>The "raw" image format is the simplest one, and is
            natively supported by both KVM and Xen hypervisors. You
            can think of a raw image as being the bit-equivalent of a
            block device file, created as if somebody had copied, say,
                <filename>/dev/sda</filename> to a file using the
                <command>dd</command> command. <note>
                <para>We don't recommend creating raw images by dd'ing
                    block device files, we discuss how to create raw
                    images later.</para>

        <title>qcow2</title>
        <para>The <link xlink:href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/QEMU/Images">qcow2</link> (QEMU
            copy-on-write version 2) format is commonly used with the KVM hypervisor. It has some
            additional features over the raw format, such as:<itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Using sparse representation, so the image size is smaller</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Support for snapshots</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist></para>
        <para>Because qcow2 is sparse, it's often faster to convert a raw image to qcow2 and upload
            it then to upload the raw file. </para>
        <para>
            <note>
                <para>Because raw images don't support snapshots, OpenStack Compute will
                    automatically convert raw image files to qcow2 as needed.</para>

            Disk Image) format for image files. None of the OpenStack Compute hypervisors support
            VDI directly, so you will need to convert these files to a different format to use them
            with OpenStack.</para>

            sizes and protection against data corruption during power failures.</para>

        <title>OVF</title>
        <para><link xlink:href="http://www.dmtf.org/standards/ovf">OVF</link> (Open Virtualization
            Format) is a packaging format for virtual machines, defined by the Distributed
            Management Task Force (DMTF) standards group. An OVF package contains one or more image
            files, a .ovf XML metadata file that contains information about the virtual machine, and
            possibly other files as well.</para>
        <para>An OVF package can be distributed in different ways. For example, it could be
            distributed as a set of discrete files, or as a tar archive file with an .ova (open
            virtual appliance/application) extension.</para>
        <para>OpenStack Compute does not currently have support for OVF packages, so you will need
            to extract the image file(s) from an OVF package if you wish to use it with
            OpenStack.</para>

                >ISO</link> format is a disk image formatted with the read-only ISO 9660 (also known
            as ECMA-119) filesystem commonly used for CDs and DVDs. While we don't normally think of
            ISO a virtual machine image format, since ISOs contain bootable filesystems with an
            installed operating system, you can treat them the same you treat other virtual machine
            image files.</para>
