    <title>Adding Block Storage nodes</title>
    <para>When your OpenStack Block Storage nodes are separate from
        your compute nodes, you can expand by adding hardware and
        installing the Block Storage service and configuring it as the
        other nodes are configured. If you use live migration, ensure
        that the CPUs are similar in the compute nodes and block
        storage nodes. In <filename>cinder.conf</filename> on each
        block storage node, set the option <literal>--iscsi_ip_prefix=
            nnn.nnn.nnn.yyy</literal>Â to register every node in the
        cinder database.</para>
