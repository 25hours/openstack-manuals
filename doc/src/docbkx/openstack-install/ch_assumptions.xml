    <title>Installation Assumptions</title>
    <para>OpenStack Compute has a large number of configuration
        options. To simplify this installation guide, we make a number
        of assumptions about the target installation. If you want a
        longer conceptual planning guide that discusses considerations
        of these decisions, refer to the <link
            xlink:href="../openstack-ops/content/">OpenStack
            Operations Guide</link>.</para>

    <para>This installation process walks through installing a cloud
        controller node and a compute node using a set of packages
        that are known to work with each other. The cloud controller
        node contains all the nova- services including the API server
        and the database server. The compute node needs to run only
        the nova-compute service. You only need one nova-network
        service running in a multi-node install, though if high
        availability for networks is required, there are additional
        options. </para>
