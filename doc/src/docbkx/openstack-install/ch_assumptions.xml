    <title>Installation Assumptions</title>
    <para>OpenStack Compute has a large number of configuration
        options. To simplify this installation guide, we make
        a number of assumptions about the target installation.</para>
    <para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para>You have a collection of compute nodes,
                each installed with Ubuntu Server 12.04</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>You have designated one of the nodes
                as the Cloud Controller, which will run all of the
                services (RabbitMQ, MySQL, Identity, Image, nova-api,
                nova-network, nova-scheduler, nova-volume) except for
                nova-compute.</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>The disk partitions on your cloud controller

                (LVM)</para></listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Your Cloud Controller has an LVM volume group named
                    "nova-volumes" to provide persistent
                    storage to guest VMs. Either create this
                    during the installation or leave some free
                    space to create it prior to installing
                    nova services.</para>

            <listitem>
                <para>Ensure that the server can resolve its own hostname,
                    otherwise you may have problems if you are using RabbitMQ
                    as the messaging backend (RabbitMQ is the default messaging
                    back-end on Ubuntu, on Fedora the default backend is Qpid).</para>

    <para>This installation process walks through installing a cloud
        controller node and a compute node using a set of packages
        that are known to work with each other. The cloud controller
        node contains all the nova- services including the API server
        and the database server. The compute node needs to run only
        the nova-compute service. You only need one nova-network
        service running in a multi-node install. </para>
