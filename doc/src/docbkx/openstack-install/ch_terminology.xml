        </title>
        <para>Each OpenStack release has a name, in increasing alphabetical
            order (e.g., Essex follows Diablo). There are also version numbers
            corresponding to these releases, but the numbering schemes are
            different for OpenStack Compute and OpenStack Object Storage, as
            shown in the table below:

            Beginning with the Cactus release, OpenStack adopted a six
            month release schedule. The Folsom release is scheduled for
            October 2012.

        <title>Code Names</title>
        <para>Each OpenStack service has a code name. For example, the Image
            Service is codenamed Glance.The full list is shown in the table
            below:

        <para>These code names are reflected in the names of configuration
            files and command-line utility programs. For example, the Identity
            service has a configuration file called
            <filename>keystone.conf</filename>.

        <title>OpenStack Services and Linux Services</title>
        <para>In the Linux world, a service (also known as a daemon) refers to
            a single program that runs in the background and typically listens
            on a port to respond to service requests. An OpenStack service, on
            the other hand, refers to a collection of Linux services working
            in concert.</para>
        <para>OpenStack services are implemented by multiple Linux services.
            For example, <command>nova-compute</command> and <command>nova-scheduler</command>
            are two of the Linux services that implement the Compute service.
            OpenStack also depends on several third-party services, such as a
            database (typically MySQL) and a message broker (typically RabbitMQ
            or Qpid).
        </para>
        <para>In this document, we generally use the term "service" to refer
            both to lower-level Linux services and higher-level OpenStack
            services. It should be clear from the context whether we are
            referring to a high-level OpenStack service (e.g., Image), or a
            low-level Linux service (e.g., <command>glance-api</command>).</para>
