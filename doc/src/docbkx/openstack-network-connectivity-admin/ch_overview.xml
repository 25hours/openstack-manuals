        <para>The Quantum project was created to provide a rich and
            tenant-facing API for defining network connectivity and

            <para>Quantum is a virtual network service that provides a
                powerful API to define the network connectivity and
                addressing used by devices from other services, such
                as OpenStack Nova.   </para>
            <para>The OpenStack Nova API has a virtual server
                abstraction to describe compute resources. Similarly,
                the Quantum API has virtual  network, subnet, and port
                abstractions to describe network resources. In more

                            server, to a Quantum network. Also
                            describes the associated network
                            configuration, such as the MAC and IP

                </itemizedlist>You can configure rich network
                topologies by creating and configuring networks and
                subnets, and then instructing other OpenStack services
                like Nova to attach virtual devices to ports on these
                networks.  In particular, Quantum supports each tenant
                having multiple private networks, and allows tenants
                to choose their own IP addressing scheme, even if
                those IP addresses overlap with those used by other
                tenants.  This enables very advanced cloud networking
                use cases, such as building multi-tiered web
                applications and allowing applications to be migrated
                to the cloud without changing IP addresses. </para>
            <para>Even if a cloud administrator does not intend to
                expose these capabilities to tenants directly, the
                Quantum API can be very useful even when used as an
                admin API because it provides significantly more
                flexibility for the cloud administrator to customize
                network offerings.  </para>
            <para>The Quantum API also provides a mechanism that lets
                cloud administrators expose additional API
                capabilities through API extensions.  Commonly, new
                capabilities are first introduced as an API extension,
                and over time become part of the core Quantum API.

                requests.  Some Quantum plugins might use basic Linux
                VLANs and IP tables, while others might use more
                advanced technologies, such as L2-in-L3 tunneling or

            <title>Overview</title>
            <para>Before you deploy Quantum, it is useful to
                understand the different components that make up the
                solution and how those components interact with each
                other and with other OpenStack services. </para>
            <para>Quantum is a standalone service, just like other
                OpenStack services such as Nova, Glance, Keystone, and
                Horizon. Like those services, a deployment of Quantum
                often involves deploying several processes on a
                variety of hosts. </para>
            <para>The main process of the Quantum Service is
                    <literal>quantum-server</literal>, which is a
                Python daemon that exposes the Quantum API and passes
                user requests to the configured Quantum plugin for
                additional processing. Typically, the plugin requires
                access to a database for persistent storage, similar
                to other OpenStack services. </para>
            <para>If your deployment uses a <emphasis role="italic"
                    >controller host</emphasis> to run centralized
                OpenStack Nova components, you can deploy Quantum on
                that same host. However, Quantum is entirely
                standalone and can be deployed on its own server as
                well. Quantum also includes additional agents that
                might be required depending on your deployment: <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para><emphasis role="bold">plugin

                                (<literal>quantum-*-agent</literal>).
                            Runs on each hypervisor to perform local
                            vswitch configuration. Agent to be run
                            depends on which plugin you are using, as
                            some plugins do not require an agent.

            <para>Horizon is has basic integration with the Quantum
                API, allowing tenants to create networks and subnets

                a VM should connect to when it is launched.  See the

                        communication between OpenStack Components.  
                        The IP addresses on this network should be
                        reachable only within the data center.
