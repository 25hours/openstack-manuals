    <title>Preface</title>
    <para>OpenStack Networking was created to provide a rich and tenant-facing
        API for defining network connectivity and addressing in the cloud. 
        The project, code-named "Neutron" (formerly known as Quantum), gives 
        operators the ability to leverage different networking technologies to 
        power their cloud networking. </para>
    <para>The Board of Directors and Technical Committee members involved in 
        Networking related development and documentation has decided to change 
        the project name to "Neutron", as part of a legal agreement with Quantum 
        Corporation, the owner of the "Quantum" trademark.</para>
    <para>Any references to the previous project code name will be removed in this guide whenever is
        possible, all the configuration files will change in Havana release and this guide will be
        updated respectively.</para>

        <para>This guide assists OpenStack administrators in
            leveraging different networking technologies to power
            their cloud networking. This document covers how to
            install, configure, and run OpenStack Networking. </para>
        <para>The user should also have access to a plugin providing
            the implementation of the OpenStack Networking service.
            Several plugins are included in the OpenStack Networking
            distribution: </para>
