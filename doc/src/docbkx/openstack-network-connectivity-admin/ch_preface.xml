    <title>Preface</title>
    <para>OpenStack Networking was created to provide a rich and
        tenant-facing API for defining network connectivity and
        addressing in the cloud. The project, code-named "quantum,"
        gives operators the ability to leverage different networking
        technologies to power their cloud networking. Â  </para>

        <title>Intended Audience</title>
        <para>This guide assists OpenStack administrators in
            leveraging different networking technologies to power
            their cloud networking. This document covers how to
            install, configure, and run OpenStack Networking. </para>
        <para>The user should also have access to a plugin providing
            the implementation of the OpenStack Networking service.
            Several plugins are included in the OpenStack Networking
            distribution: </para>
