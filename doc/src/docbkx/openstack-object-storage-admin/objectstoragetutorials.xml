    <title>OpenStack Object Storage Tutorials</title> 
    <para>We want people to use OpenStack for practical problem solving, and the increasing size and
        density of web content makes for a great use-case for object storage. These tutorials show
        you how to use your OpenStack Object Storage installation for practical purposes, and it
        assumes Object Storage is already installed.</para>

        <title>Storing Large Photos or Videos on the Cloud</title>
        
        <para>In this OpenStack tutorial, weâ€™ll walk through using an Object Storage installation to
            back up all your photos or videos. As the sensors on consumer-grade and pro-sumer grade
            cameras generate more and more megapixels, we all need a place to back our files to and
            know they are safe. </para>
        
        <para>We'll go through this tutorial in parts:</para>

            <title>Part I: Setting Up Secure Access</title>
            <para>In this part, we'll get the proxy server running with SSL on the Object Storage
                installation. It's a requirement for using Cyberduck as a client interface to Object
                Storage.</para>
            <para>You will need a key and certificate to do this, which we can create as a
                self-signed for the tutorial since we can do the extra steps to have Cyberduck
                accept it. Creating a self-signed cert can usually be done with these commands on
                the proxy server: </para>

<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out cert.crt -keyout cert.key</userinput>     </screen>

            <para>Ensure these generated files are in /etc/swift/cert.crt and /etc/swift/cert.key. </para>
            <para>You also should configure your iptables to enable https traffic. Here's an example
                setup that works.</para>

                <para>Okay, you've created the access that Cyberduck expects for your Object Storage

              After installing Cyberduck you'll need to change the path/context
              used for the authentication URL. The default value shipped with
              Cyberduck is incorrect.
            </para>
            <para>
              On OS X open a Terminal window and execute,
              <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>defaults write ch.sudo.cyberduck cf.authentication.context /auth/v1.0</userinput></screen>
            </para>

                need to start and stop Cyberduck to have it generate
                the config file. Once you've opened the file add the
                setting,
