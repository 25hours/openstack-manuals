    <title>System Documentation Requirements</title>
    <para>The system documentation for an OpenStack cloud deployment should follow the templates and best practices for the Enterprise Information Technology System in your organization. Organizations often have compliance requirements which may require an overall System Security Plan to inventory and document the architecture of a given system. There are common challenges across the industry related to documenting the dynamic cloud infrastructure and keeping the information up-to-date.</para>

      <title>System Roles &amp; Types</title>
      <para>It is necessary to describe the two broadly defined types of nodes that generally make up an OpenStack installation.</para>
      <orderedlist><listitem>
          <para> Infrastructure nodes, or the nodes that run the cloud related services such as the OpenStack Identity service, the message queuing service, storage, networking, and other services required to support the operation of the cloud.</para>
        </listitem>
<listitem>
          <para> The other type of nodes are compute, storage, or other resource nodes, those that provide storage capacity or virtual machines for your cloud.</para>

      <title>System Inventory</title>
      <para>Documentation should provide a general description of the OpenStack environment and cover all systems used (production, development, test, etc.). Documenting system components, networks, services, and software often provides the bird's-eye view needed to thoroughly cover and consider security concerns, attack vectors and possible security domain bridging points.  A system inventory may need to capture ephemeral resources such as virtual machines or virtual disk volumes that would otherwise be persistent resources in a traditional IT system.</para>

        <title>Hardware Inventory</title>
        <para>Clouds without stringent compliance requirements for written documentation may at least benefit from having a Configuration Management Database (CMDB). CMDB's are normally used for hardware asset tracking and overall life-cycle management. By leveraging a CMDB, an organization can quickly identify cloud infrastructure hardware (e.g. compute nodes, storage nodes, and network devices) that exists on the network but may not be adequately protected and/or forgotten. OpenStack provisioning system may provide some CMDB-like functions especially if auto-discovery features of hardware attributes are available.</para>

      <section xml:id="ch008_system-roles-types-idp53536">
        <title>Software Inventory</title>
        <para>Just as with hardware, all software components within the OpenStack deployment should be documented. Components here should include system databases; OpenStack software components and supporting sub-components; and, supporting infrastructure software such as load-balancers, reverse proxies and network address translators. Having an authoritative list like this may be critical toward understanding total system impact due to a compromise or vulnerability of a specific class of software.</para>

      <title>Network Topology</title>
      <para>A Network Topology should be provided with highlights specifically calling out the data flows and bridging points between the security domains. Network ingress and egress points should be identified along with any OpenStack logical system boundaries. Multiple diagrams may be needed to provide complete visual coverage of the system.  A network topology document should include virtual networks created on behalf of tenants by the system along with virtual machine instances and gateways created by OpenStack.</para>

      <title>Services, Protocols and Ports</title>
      <para>The Service, Protocols and Ports table provides important additional detail of an OpenStack deployment. A table view of all services running within the cloud infrastructure can immediately inform, guide and check security procedures. Firewall configuration, service port conflicts, security remediation areas, and compliance requirements become easier to manage when you have concise information available. E.g. tablular information as shown below.</para>
      <para><inlinemediaobject><imageobject role="html">
            <imagedata contentdepth="166" contentwidth="967" fileref="static/services-protocols-ports.png" format="PNG" scalefit="1"/>
          </imageobject>
<imageobject role="fo">
            <imagedata contentdepth="100%" fileref="static/services-protocols-ports.png" format="PNG" scalefit="1" width="100%"/>
          </imageobject>
</inlinemediaobject></para>
      <para>Referencing a table of services, protocols and ports can help in understanding the relationship between OpenStack components. It it highly suggested that OpenStack deployments have information similar to this on record.</para>
