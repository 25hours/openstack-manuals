    <title>Database Backend Considerations</title>
    <para>The choice of database server is an important consideration in the security of an OpenStack deployment. While security considerations are not the only basis on which a database server must be chosen, security considerations are the only ones within the scope of this book. In practice, OpenStack only supports two database types: PostgreSQL and MySQL.</para>
    <para>PostgreSQL has a number of desirable security features such as Kerberos authentication, object-level security, and encryption support. The PostgreSQL community has done well to provide solid guidance, documentation, and tooling to promote positive security practices.</para>
    <para>MySQL has a large community, wide-spread adoption, and provides high availability options. MySQL also has the ability to provide enhanced client authentication by way of plug-in authentication mechanisms. Forked distributions in the MySQL community provide many options for consideration. It is important to choose a specific implementation of MySQL based on a thorough evaluation of the security posture and the level of support provided for the given distribution.</para>
