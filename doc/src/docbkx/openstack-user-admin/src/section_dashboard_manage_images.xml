    <title>Manage images</title>
    <para>During setup of OpenStack cloud, the cloud operator sets
        user permissions to manage images. Image upload and management
        might be restricted to only cloud administrators or cloud
        operators. Though you can complete most tasks with the
        OpenStack dashboard, you can manage images through only the
        glance and nova clients or the Image Service and Compute APIs.
