    <para>OpenStack is a global collaboration of developers and cloud
        computing technologists producing the ubiquitous open source
        cloud computing platform for public and private clouds. </para>
    <para>The project delivers solutions for all types of clouds by
        being simple to implement, massively scalable, and feature
        rich. </para>
    <para>The technology consists of a series of interrelated projects
        that deliver various components for a cloud infrastructure
        solution. </para>
    <para>This guide helps OpenStack cloud administrators and users
        launch and manage instances and manage volumes. You can
        achieve most of these tasks with the OpenStack dashboard or
        the OpenStack command-line clients. </para>
    <para>The OpenStack dashboard, also known as <link
            xlink:href="https://github.com/openstack/horizon/"
            >horizon</link>, is a Web interface that allows cloud
        administrators and users to manage various OpenStack resources
        and services. The dashboard enables web-based interactions
        with the OpenStack Compute cloud controller through the
        OpenStack APIs.</para>
    <para>The OpenStack project also provides a variety of
        command-line clients that let you manage resources and
        services within your cloud and automate tasks by using
        scripts. Each of the core OpenStack components has its own
        command-line client.</para>
    <para>The exercises help you learn how cURL commands and the
        OpenStack APIs work.</para>
    <para>To use the OpenStack APIs, it helps to be familiar with
        HTTP/1.1, RESTful web services, the OpenStack services, and
        JSON or XML data serialization formats.</para>
