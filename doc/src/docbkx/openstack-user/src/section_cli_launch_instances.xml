    <title>Launch instances</title>

    <para>Instances are virtual machines that run inside the
        cloud.</para>
    <para>You can launch an instance directly from one of the
        available OpenStack images or from an image that you have
        copied to a persistent volume. The OpenStack Image Service
        provides a pool of images that are accessible to members of
        different projects.</para>
    <para>To launch an instance, you must specify the following
        parameters:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>The <guilabel>instance source</guilabel>, which is
                an image or snapshot. Alternatively, you can boot from
                a volume, which is block storage, to which you've
                copied an image or snapshot.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>The <guilabel>image</guilabel> or
                    <guilabel>snapshot</guilabel>, which represents
                the operating system.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>A <guilabel>name</guilabel> for your instance.
            </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>The <emphasis role="bold">flavor</emphasis> for your
                instance, which defines the compute, memory, and
                storage capacity of nova computing instances. A flavor
                is an available hardware configuration for a server.
                It defines the "size" of a virtual server that can be
                launched. For more details and a list of default
                flavors available, see Section 1.5, "Managing
                Flavors," (â†‘ User Guide for Administrators ). </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Access and security credentials, which include one
                or both of the following credentials:</para>
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>A <emphasis role="bold">keypair</emphasis>
                        for your instance, which are SSH credentials
                        that are injected into images when they are
                        launched. For this to work, the image must
                        contain the <literal>cloud-init</literal>
                        package. Create at least one keypair for each
                        project. If you already have generated a
                        keypair with an external tool, you can import
                        it into OpenStack. You can use the keypair for
                        multiple instances that belong to that
                        project. For details, refer to Section 1.5.1,
                        Creating or Importing Keys. </para>

                        incoming network traffic is forwarded to
                        instances. Security groups hold a set of

            <para>Now you have all the parameters required to launch
                an instance, run the following command:</para>

            <para>The status BUILD indicates that the instance has

        <step>
            <para>Check if the instance is online:</para>
            <programlisting language="bash"><prompt>$</prompt> nova list</programlisting>
            <para>This command lists all instances of the project you

            <para>If your instance's status is ACTIVE, the instance is
                online. </para>
            <para>To view the available options for the <command>nova

        <step>
            <para>If you did not provide a keypair, security groups,
                or rules, you can only access the instance from inside
                the cloud through VNC. Even pinging the instance is
                not possible. </para>
