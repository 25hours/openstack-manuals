    <title>OpenStack RC file</title>
    <para>To set the required environment variables for the OpenStack
        command-line clients, you must download and source an
        environment file, <filename>openrc.sh</filename>. It is
        project-specific and contains the credentials used by
        OpenStack Compute, Image, and Identity services.</para>
    <para>When you source the file and enter the password, environment
        variables are set for that shell. They allow the commands to
        communicate to the OpenStack services that run in the
        cloud.</para>
    <para>You can download the file from the OpenStack dashboard as an
        administrative user or any other user.</para>

        <title>To download the OpenStack RC file</title>
        <step>
            <para>Log in to the OpenStack dashboard.</para>
        </step>
        <step>
            <para>On the <guilabel>Project</guilabel> tab, select the
                project for which you want to download the OpenStack
                RC file.</para>
        </step>
        <step>
            <para>Click <emphasis role="bold">Access &amp;
                    Security</emphasis>. Then, click
                    <guibutton>Download OpenStack RC File</guibutton>
                and save the file.</para>
        </step>
        <step>
            <para>Copy the <filename>openrc.sh</filename> file to the
                machine from where you want to run OpenStack commands.</para>
            <para>For example, copy the file to the machine from where
                you want to upload an image with a glance client
                command.</para>
        </step>
        <step>
            <para>On any shell from where you want to run OpenStack
                commands, source the <filename>openrc.sh</filename>
                file for the respective project.</para>
            <para>In this example, we source the
                    <filename>demo-openrc.sh</filename> file for the
                demo project:</para>
            <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>source demo-openrc.sh</userinput></screen>
        </step>
        <step>
            <para>When you are prompted for an OpenStack password,
                enter the OpenStack password for the user who
                downloaded the <filename>openrc.sh</filename>
                file.</para>  </step> <step><para>When you run OpenStack client commands, you can override some
                environment variable settings by using the options
                that are listed at the end of the <command>nova
                    help</command> output. For example, you can
                override the <literal>OS_PASSWORD</literal> setting in
                the <filename>openrc.sh</filename> file by specifying
                a password on a nova command, as follows: </para>
            <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>nova --password &lt;password> image-list</userinput></screen>
                    <para>Where <parameter>password</parameter> is
                your password.</para>
        </step>
