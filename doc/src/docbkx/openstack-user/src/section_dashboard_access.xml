            <para>Ask your cloud operator for the following
                information:</para>

                <listitem>
                    <para>The host name or public IP address from

        <step>

            <note>
                <title>Certificate Warning</title>
                <para>You might get a certificate warning when you try
                    to access the URL for the first time depending on
                    your browser and browser options. In case no
                    certificate is provided when the cloud operator
                    sets up the dashboard, the OpenStack cloud uses a
                    self-signed certificate that is not considered
                    trustworthy by default. In this case, verify the
                    certificate. To proceed anyway, you can add an
                    exception in the browser to bypass the warning.
