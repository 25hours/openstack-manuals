    <para>Instances are virtual machines that run inside the cloud.
        You can launch an instance directly from one of the available
        OpenStack images or from an image that you have copied to a
        persistent volume. The OpenStack Image Service provides a pool
        of images that are accessible to members of different
        projects.</para>
