    <para>Instances are virtual machines that run inside the

    <para>You can launch an instance directly from one of the
        available OpenStack images or from an image that you have
        copied to a persistent volume. The OpenStack Image Service
        provides a pool of images that are accessible to members of

                    A flavor is an available hardware configuration
