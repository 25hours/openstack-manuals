        <para>You can launch an instance directly from one of the
            images available through the OpenStack Image Service or
            from an image that you have copied to a persistent volume.
            When you launch an instance from a volume, the procedure
            is basically the same as when launching an instance from
            an image in OpenStack Image Service, except for some
            additional steps.</para>

                When you do that, OpenStack creates a local copy of
                the image on the respective compute node where the
                instance is started.</para>

                    In that case, the instance is booted from the
