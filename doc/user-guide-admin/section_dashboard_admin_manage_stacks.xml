    <para>The Orchestration service provides a template-based orchestration engine
        for the OpenStack cloud, which can be used to create and manage cloud
        infrastructure resources such as storage, networking, instances, and
        applications as a repeatable running environment.
    </para>
    <para>Templates are used to create stacks, which are collections of resources. For example,
        a stack might include instances, floating IPs, volumes, security groups, or users.
        The Orchestration service offers access to all OpenStack core services via a single modular template,
        with additional orchestration capabilities such as auto-scaling and basic high availability.</para>
