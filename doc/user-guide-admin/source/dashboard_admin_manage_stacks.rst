Launch and manage stacks
========================

The Orchestration service provides a template-based orchestration
engine for the OpenStack cloud, which can be used to create and manage
cloud infrastructure resources such as storage, networking, instances,
and applications as a repeatable running environment.

Templates are used to create stacks, which are collections of resources.
For example, a stack might include instances, floating IPs, volumes,
security groups, or users. The Orchestration service offers access to
all OpenStack core services via a single modular template, with
additional orchestration capabilities such as auto-scaling and basic
high availability.

For information about:

* administrative tasks on the command line, see the section called
  “Launch and manage stacks”;

  .. note::
    There are no administration-specific tasks that can be done through
    the dashboard.

* the basic creation and deletion of Orchestration stacks, refer to the
  `End User Guide`.
