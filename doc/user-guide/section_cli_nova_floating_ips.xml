    <para>Each instance has a private, fixed IP address and can also have a public, or floating,
        address. Private IP addresses are used for communication between instances, and public
        addresses are used for communication with networks outside the cloud, including the
        Internet.</para>
    <para>When you launch an instance, it is automatically assigned a
        private IP address that stays the same until you explicitly
        terminate the instance. Rebooting an instance has no effect on
        the private IP address.</para>
    <para>A pool of floating IP addresses, configured by the cloud administrator, is available in
        OpenStack Compute. The project quota defines the maximum number of floating IP addresses
        that you can allocate to the project. After you allocate a floating IP address to a project,
        you can:</para>
