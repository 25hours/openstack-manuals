    <title>Manage IP addresses</title>
    <para>Each instance can have a private, or fixed, IP address and a
        public, or floating, one.</para>
    <para>Private IP addresses are used for communication between instances, and
        public ones are used for communication with networks outside the cloud,
        including the Internet.</para>
    <para>When you launch an instance, it is automatically assigned a
        private IP address that stays the same until you explicitly
        terminate the instance. Rebooting an instance has no effect on
        the private IP address.</para>
    <para>A pool of floating IP addresses, configured by the cloud operator, is
        available in OpenStack Compute. You can allocate a certain number of
        these IP addresses to a project. The maximum number of floating IP
        addresses per project is defined by the quota.</para>
    <para>After you allocate floating IP addresses to a project, you can add a
        floating IP address from this set to an instance of the project. You can
        assign a floating IP address to one instance at a time. Floating IP
        addresses can be disassociated from an instance and associated with
        another instance of the same project at any time.</para>
