  <para>OpenStack Object Storage provides a distributed,
    API-accessible storage platform that can be integrated directly
    into an application or used to store any type of file, including
    VM images, backups, archives, or media files. In the OpenStack
    Dashboard, you can only manage containers and objects.</para>
      <para>In OpenStack Object Storage, containers provide storage
    for objects in a manner similar to a Windows folder or Linux file
    directory, though they cannot be nested. An object in OpenStack
    consists of the file to be stored in the container and any
    accompanying metadata.</para>
