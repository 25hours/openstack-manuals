  <title>Authenticate</title>
  <para>When using the SDK, you must authenticate against an OpenStack
    endpoint before you can use OpenStack services. Each project uses
    a slightly different syntax for authentication.</para>
  <para>You must typically authenticate against a specific version of
    a service. For example, a client might need to authenticate
    against Identity v2.0.</para>
  <para>Python scripts that use the OpenStack SDK must have access to the
  credentials contained in the
  <link linkend="cli_openrc">OpenStack RC file</link>. Because credentials
  are sensitive information, do not include them in your scripts. This guide
  assumes that users source the
  <filename><replaceable>PROJECT</replaceable>-openrc.sh</filename>
  file and access the credentials by using the environment variables
  in the Python scripts.</para>
