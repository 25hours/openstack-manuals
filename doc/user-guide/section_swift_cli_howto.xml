    <title>Manage object storage</title>
    <para>The Object Storage service provides the
            <command>swift</command> command-line interface (CLI) that
        enables you to gather statistics, list items, update metadata,
        upload, download, and delete files. This client is based on
        the native swift client library, <literal>client.py</literal>,
        which seamlessly re-authenticates if the current token expires
        during processing, retries operations multiple times, and
        provides a processing concurrency of 10.</para>
        <para>Users have roles on accounts. For example, the admin
        role enables full access to all containers and objects in an
        account.</para>
    <para>You can set access control lists (ACLs) at the container level
        and support lists for read and write access, which are set
        with the <literal>X-Container-Read</literal> and
            <literal>X-Container-Write</literal> header
        respectively.</para>
        <para>You can use the <command>swift</command> client to set
        the ACLs by using the <command>post</command> subcommand with
        the <parameter>-r</parameter> parameter for the read access
        and <parameter>-w</parameter> parameter for the write access.
        The following example enables the <literal>testuser</literal>
        user to read objects in the container:</para>
            <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>swift post -r 'testuser'</userinput></screen>
<para>You can also use this command with a list of users.</para>
        <para>If you use the StaticWeb middleware to enable Object
        Storage to serve public web content, the syntax for allowed
        referrers is <literal>.r:</literal> followed by a list of
        allowed referrers.</para>
    <para>The following command gives object access to all referring
        domains:</para>
            <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>swift post -r '.r:*'</userinput></screen>
