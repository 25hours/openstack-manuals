Create and manage volumes
=========================

Volumes are block storage devices that you attach to instances to enable
persistent storage. You can attach a volume to a running instance or
detach a volume and attach it to another instance at any time. You can
also create a snapshot from or delete a volume. Only administrative
users can create volume types.

Create a volume
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Log in to the dashboard, choose a project, and click :guilabel:`Volumes`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Create Volume`.

   In the dialog box that opens, enter or select the following values.

   :guilabel:`Volume Name`: Specify a name for the volume.

   :guilabel:`Description`: Optionally, provide a brief description for the
   volume.

   :guilabel:`Type`: Leave this field blank.

   :guilabel:`Size (GB)`: The size of the volume in gibibytes (GiB).

   :guilabel:`Volume Source`: Select one of the following options:

   * No source, empty volume: Creates an empty volume. An empty volume does
     not contain a file system or a partition table.

   * Snapshot: If you choose this option, a new field for Use snapshot as a
     source displays. You can select the snapshot from the list.

   * Image: If you choose this option, a new field for Use image as a source
     displays. You can select the image from the list.

   * Availability Zone: Select the Availability Zone from the list. By
     default, this value is set to the availability zone given by the cloud
     provider (for example, ``us-west`` or ``apac-south``). For some cases,
     it could be ``nova``.

   * Volume: If you choose this option, a new field for
     :guilabel:`Use volume as a source` displays. You can select the volume
     from the list. Options to use a snapshot or a volume as the source for a
     volume are displayed only if there are existing snapshots or volumes.

#. Click :guilabel:`Create Volume`.

The dashboard shows the volume on the :guilabel:`Volumes` tab.

Attach a volume to an instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you create one or more volumes, you can attach them to instances.
You can attach a volume to one instance at a time.

#. Log in to the dashboard, choose a project, and click :guilabel:`Volumes`.

#. Select the volume to add to an instance and click
   :guilabel:`Edit Attachments`.

#. In the :guilabel:`Manage Volume Attachments` dialog box, select an instance.

#. Enter the name of the device from which the volume is accessible by
   the instance.

   .. note: The actual device name might differ from the volume name because
      of hypervisor settings.

#. Click :guilabel:`Attach Volume`.

   The dashboard shows the instance to which the volume is now attached
   and the device name.

You can view the status of a volume in the Volumes tab of the dashboard.
The volume is either Available or In-Use.

Now you can log in to the instance and mount, format, and use the disk.
