====================
OpenStack Python SDK
====================

The OpenStack Python Software Development Kit (SDK) is used to write Python
automation scripts that create and manage resources in your OpenStack
cloud. The SDK implements Python bindings to the OpenStack API, which
enables you to perform automation tasks in Python by making calls on
Python objects, rather than making REST calls directly. All OpenStack
command-line tools are implemented using the Python SDK.

You should also be familiar with:

- RESTful web services
- HTTP/1.1
- JSON and XML data serialization formats
