OpenStack dashboard
===================

   As a cloud administrative user, the OpenStack dashboard lets you
   create and manage projects, users, images, and flavors. You can
   also set quotas and create and manage services. For information
   about using the dashboard to perform end user tasks, see the
   `OpenStack End User Guide <http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/>`__.
